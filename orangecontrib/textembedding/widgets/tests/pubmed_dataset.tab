cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The histone methyltransferases Set5 and Set1 have overlapping functions in gene silencing and telomere maintenance. Genes Adjacent To Telomeres Are Subject To Transcriptional Repression Mediated By An Integrated Set Of Chromatin Modifying And Remodeling Factors. The Telomeres Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Have Served As A Model For Dissecting The Function Of Diverse Chromatin Proteins In Gene Silencing, And Their Study Has Revealed Overlapping Roles For Many Chromatin Proteins In Either Promoting Or Antagonizing Gene Repression. The H3K4 Methyltransferase Set1, Which Is Commonly Linked To Transcriptional Activation, Has Been Implicated In Telomere Silencing. Set5 Is An H4 K5, K8, And K12 Methyltransferase That Functions With Set1 To Promote Repression At Telomeres. Here, We Analyzed The Combined Role For Set1 And Set5 In Gene Expression Control At Native Yeast Telomeres. Our Data Reveal That Set1 And Set5 Promote A Sir Protein-Independent Mechanism Of Repression That May Primarily Rely On Regulation Of H4K5Ac And H4K8Ac At Telomeric Regions. Furthermore, Cells Lacking Both Set1 And Set5 Have Highly Correlated Transcriptomes To Mutants In Telomere Maintenance Pathways And Display Defects In Telomere Stability, Linking Their Roles In Silencing To Protection Of Telomeres. Our Data Therefore Provide Insight Into And Clarify Potential Mechanisms By Which Set1 Contributes To Telomere Silencing And Shed Light On The Function Of Set5 At Telomeres.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Molecular Mechanism of DNA Topoisomerase I-Dependent rDNA Silencing: Sir2p Recruitment at Ribosomal Genes. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Sir2Δ Or Top1Δ Mutants Exhibit Similar Phenotypes Involving Ribosomal Dna, Including (I) Loss Of Transcriptional Silencing, Resulting In Non-Coding Rna Hyperproduction From Cryptic Rna Polymerase Ii Promoters; (Ii) Alterations In Recombination; And (Iii) A General Increase In Histone Acetylation. Given The Distinct Enzymatic Activities Of Sir2 And Top1 Proteins, A Histone Deacetylase And A Dna Topoisomerase, Respectively, We Investigated Whether Genetic And/Or Physical Interactions Between The Two Proteins Could Explain The Shared Ribosomal Rna Genes (Rdna) Phenotypes. We Employed An Approach Of Complementing Top1Δ Cells With Yeast, Human, Truncated, And Chimeric Yeast/Human Top1 Constructs And Of Assessing The Extent Of Non-Coding Rna Silencing And Histone H4K16 Deacetylation. Our Findings Demonstrate That Residues 115-125 Within The Yeast Top1P N-Terminal Domain Are Required For The Complementation Of The Top1∆ Rdna Phenotypes. In Chromatin Immunoprecipitation And Co-Immunoprecipitation Experiments, We Further Demonstrate The Physical Interaction Between Top1P And Sir2P. Our Genetic And Biochemical Studies Support A Model Whereby Top1P Recruits Sir2P To The Rdna And Clarifies A Structural Role Of Dna Topoisomerase I In The Epigenetic Regulation Of Rdna, Independent Of Its Known Catalytic Activity.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Combined Action of Histone Reader Modules Regulates NuA4 Local Acetyltransferase Function but Not Its Recruitment on the Genome. Recognition Of Histone Marks By Reader Modules Is Thought To Be At The Heart Of Epigenetic Mechanisms. These Protein Domains Are Considered To Function By Targeting Regulators To Chromosomal Loci Carrying Specific Histone Modifications. This Is Important For Proper Gene Regulation As Well As Propagation Of Epigenetic Information. The Nua4 Acetyltransferase Complex Contains Two Of These Reader Modules, An H3K4Me3-Specific Plant Homeodomain (Phd) Within The Yng2 Subunit And An H3K36Me2/3-Specific Chromodomain In The Eaf3 Subunit. While Each Domain Showed A Close Functional Interaction With The Respective Histone Mark That It Recognizes, At The Biochemical Level, Genetic Level (As Assessed With Epistatic Miniarray Profile Screens), And Phenotypic Level, Cells With The Combined Loss Of Both Readers Showed Greatly Enhanced Phenotypes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Coupled With Next-Generation Sequencing Experiments Demonstrated That The Yng2 Phd Specifically Directs H4 Acetylation Near The Transcription Start Site Of Highly Expressed Genes, While Eaf3 Is Important Downstream On The Body Of The Genes. Strikingly, The Recruitment Of The Nua4 Complex To These Loci Was Not Significantly Affected. Furthermore, Rna Polymerase Ii Occupancy Was Decreased Only Under Conditions Where Both Phd And Chromodomains Were Lost, Generally In The Second Half Of The Gene Coding Regions. Altogether, These Results Argue That Methylated Histone Reader Modules In Nua4 Are Not Responsible For Its Recruitment To The Promoter Or Coding Regions But, Rather, Are Required To Orient Its Acetyltransferase Catalytic Site To The Methylated Histone 3-Bearing Nucleosomes In The Surrounding Chromatin, Cooperating To Allow Proper Transition From Transcription Initiation To Elongation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Enhanced transgene expression by plasmid-specific recruitment of histone acetyltransferase. Histone Acetylation Is Associated With The Activation Of Genes On Chromosomes. Transgene Expression From Plasmid Dna Might Be Increased By The Acetylation Of Histones Bound To Plasmid Dna. To Examine This Hypothesis, We Employed A Positive Feedback System, Using A Fusion Protein Of The Sequence-Specific Dna Binding Domain Of Yeast Gal4 And The Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Domain Of Mouse Creb-Binding Protein (Gal4-Hat), In Which Gal4-Hat Promotes Its Own Expression As Well As That Of A Reporter Gene Product (Luciferase). The Activator Plasmid Dna Carrying The Gene Encoding Gal4-Hat Was Introduced Into Mouse Hepa1-6 Cells, Together With The Reporter Plasmid Dna, By Lipofection. Significantly Increased Luciferase Expression Was Observed By The Co-Introduction Of The Activator Plasmid Dna. Moreover, The Acetylation Of Histones Bound To The Reporter Plasmid Dna Was Enriched By The Activator Plasmid Dna. These Results Indicated That The Gal4-Hat System Is Useful For Enhanced Transgene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The Nuts and Bolts of Transcriptionally Silent Chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcriptional Silencing In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Occurs At Several Genomic Sites Including The Silent Mating-Type Loci, Telomeres, And The Ribosomal Dna (Rdna) Tandem Array. Epigenetic Silencing At Each Of These Domains Is Characterized By The Absence Of Nearly All Histone Modifications, Including Most Prominently The Lack Of Histone H4 Lysine 16 Acetylation. In All Cases, Silencing Requires Sir2, A Highly-Conserved Nad(+)-Dependent Histone Deacetylase. At Locations Other Than The Rdna, Silencing Also Requires Additional Sir Proteins, Sir1, Sir3, And Sir4 That Together Form A Repressive Heterochromatin-Like Structure Termed Silent Chromatin. The Mechanisms Of Silent Chromatin Establishment, Maintenance, And Inheritance Have Been Investigated Extensively Over The Last 25 Years, And These Studies Have Revealed Numerous Paradigms For Transcriptional Repression, Chromatin Organization, And Epigenetic Gene Regulation. Studies Of Sir2-Dependent Silencing At The Rdna Have Also Contributed To Understanding The Mechanisms For Maintaining The Stability Of Repetitive Dna And Regulating Replicative Cell Aging. The Goal Of This Comprehensive Review Is To Distill A Wide Array Of Biochemical, Molecular Genetic, Cell Biological, And Genomics Studies Down To The "Nuts And Bolts" Of Silent Chromatin And The Processes That Yield Transcriptional Silencing.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Promotion of Cell Viability and Histone Gene Expression by the Acetyltransferase Gcn5 and the Protein Phosphatase PP2A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Histone Modifications Direct Chromatin-Templated Events In The Genome And Regulate Access To Dna Sequence Information. There Are Multiple Types Of Modifications, And A Common Feature Is Their Dynamic Nature. An Essential Step For Understanding Their Regulation, Therefore, Lies In Characterizing The Enzymes Responsible For Adding And Removing Histone Modifications. Starting With A Dosage-Suppressor Screen In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, We Have Discovered A Functional Interaction Between The Acetyltransferase Gcn5 And The Protein Phosphatase 2A (Pp2A) Complex, Two Factors That Regulate Post-Translational Modifications. We Find That Rts1, One Of Two Genes Encoding Pp2A Regulatory Subunits, Is A Robust And Specific High-Copy Suppressor Of Temperature Sensitivity Of Gcn5∆ And A Subset Of Other Gcn5∆ Phenotypes. Conversely, Loss Of Both Pp2A(Rts1) And Gcn5 Function In The Saga And Slik/Salsa Complexes Is Lethal. Rts1 Does Not Restore Global Transcriptional Defects In Gcn5∆; However, Histone Gene Expression Is Restored, Suggesting That The Mechanism Of Rts1 Rescue Includes Restoration Of Specific Cell Cycle Transcripts. Pointing To New Mechanisms Of Acetylation-Phosphorylation Cross-Talk, Rts1 High-Copy Rescue Of Gcn5∆ Growth Requires Two Residues Of H2B That Are Phosphorylated In Human Cells. These Data Highlight The Potential Significance Of Dynamic Phosphorylation And Dephosphorylation Of These Deeply Conserved Histone Residues For Cell Viability.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cooperation between SAGA and SWI/SNF complexes is required for efficient transcriptional responses regulated by the yeast MAPK Slt2. The Transcriptional Response Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae To Cell Wall Stress Is Mainly Mediated By The Cell Wall Integrity (Cwi) Pathway Through The Mapk Slt2 And The Transcription Factor Rlm1. Once Activated, Rlm1 Interacts With The Chromatin Remodeling Swi/Snf Complex Which Locally Alters Nucleosome Positioning At The Target Promoters. Here We Show That The Saga Complex Plays Along With The Swi/Snf Complex An Important Role For Eliciting Both Early Induction And Sustained Gene Expression Upon Stress. Gcn5 Co-Regulates Together With Swi3 The Majority Of The Cwi Transcriptional Program, Except For A Group Of Genes Which Are Only Dependent On The Swi/Snf Complex. Saga Subunits Are Recruited To The Promoter Of Cwi-Responsive Genes In A Slt2, Rlm1 And Swi/Snf-Dependent Manner. However, Gcn5 Mediates Acetylation And Nucleosome Eviction Only At The Promoters Of The Saga-Dependent Genes. This Process Is Not Essential For Pre-Initiation Transcriptional Complex Assembly But Rather Increase The Extent Of The Remodeling Mediated By Swi/Snf. As A Consequence, H3 Eviction And Rlm1 Recruitment Is Completely Blocked In A Swi3Δ Gcn5Δ Double Mutant. Therefore, Saga Complex, Through Its Histone Acetylase Activity, Cooperates With The Swi/Snf Complex For The Mandatory Nucleosome Displacement Required For Full Gene Expression Through The Cwi Pathway.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Local potentiation of stress-responsive genes by upstream noncoding transcription. It Has Been Postulated That A Myriad Of Long Noncoding Rnas (Lncrnas) Contribute To Gene Regulation. In Fission Yeast, Glucose Starvation Triggers Lncrna Transcription Across Promoter Regions Of Stress-Responsive Genes Including Fbp1 (Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase1). At The Fbp1 Promoter, This Transcription Promotes Chromatin Remodeling And Fbp1 Mrna Expression. Here, We Demonstrate That Such Upstream Noncoding Transcription Facilitates Promoter Association Of The Stress-Responsive Transcriptional Activator Atf1 At The Sites Of Transcription, Leading To Activation Of The Downstream Stress Genes. Genome-Wide Analyses Revealed That ∼50 Atf1-Binding Sites Show Marked Decrease In Atf1 Occupancy When Cells Are Treated With A Transcription Inhibitor. Most Of These Transcription-Enhanced Atf1-Binding Sites Are Associated With Stress-Dependent Induction Of The Adjacent Mrnas Or Lncrnas, As Observed In Fbp1 These Atf1-Binding Sites Exhibit Low Atf1 Occupancy And High Histone Density In Glucose-Rich Conditions, And Undergo Dramatic Changes In Chromatin Status After Glucose Depletion: Enhanced Atf1 Binding, Histone Eviction, And Histone H3 Acetylation. We Also Found That Upstream Transcripts Bind To The Groucho-Tup1 Type Transcriptional Corepressors Tup11 And Tup12, And Locally Antagonize Their Repressive Functions On Atf1 Binding. These Results Reveal A New Mechanism In Which Upstream Noncoding Transcription Locally Magnifies The Specific Activation Of Stress-Inducible Genes Via Counteraction Of Corepressors.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromosome-wide histone deacetylation by sirtuins prevents hyperactivation of DNA damage-induced signaling upon replicative stress. The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Genome Encodes Five Sirtuins (Sir2 And Hst1-4), Which Constitute A Conserved Family Of Nad-Dependent Histone Deacetylases. Cells Lacking Any Individual Sirtuin Display Mild Growth And Gene Silencing Defects. However, Hst3Δ Hst4Δ Double Mutants Are Exquisitely Sensitive To Genotoxins, And Hst3Δ Hst4Δ Sir2Δmutants Are Inviable. Our Published Data Also Indicate That Pharmacological Inhibition Of Sirtuins Prevents Growth Of Several Fungal Pathogens, Although The Biological Basis Is Unclear. Here, We Present Genome-Wide Fitness Assays Conducted With Nicotinamide (Nam), A Pan-Sirtuin Inhibitor. Our Data Indicate That Nam Treatment Causes Yeast To Solicit Specific Dna Damage Response Pathways For Survival, And That Nam-Induced Growth Defects Are Mainly Attributable To Inhibition Of Hst3 And Hst4 And Consequent Elevation Of Histone H3 Lysine 56 Acetylation (H3K56Ac). Our Results Further Reveal That In The Presence Of Constitutive H3K56Ac, The Slx4 Scaffolding Protein And Pp4 Phosphatase Complex Play Essential Roles In Preventing Hyperactivation Of The Dna Damage-Response Kinase Rad53 In Response To Spontaneous Dna Damage Caused By Reactive Oxygen Species. Overall, Our Data Support The Concept That Chromosome-Wide Histone Deacetylation By Sirtuins Is Critical To Mitigate Growth Defects Caused By Endogenous Genotoxins.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Global mapping of the regulatory interactions of histone residues. Histone Residues Can Serve As Platforms For Specific Regulatory Function. Here We Constructed A Map Of Regulatory Associations Between Histone Residues And A Wide Spectrum Of Chromatin Regulation Factors Based On Gene Expression Changes By Histone Point Mutations In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Detailed Analyses Of This Map Revealed Novel Associations. Regarding The Modulation Of H3K4 And K36 Methylation By Set1, Set2, Or Jhd2, We Proposed A Role For H4K91 Acetylation In Early Pol Ii Elongation, And For H4K16 Deacetylation In Late Elongation And Crosstalk With H3K4 Demethylation For Gene Silencing. The Association Of H3K56 With Nucleosome Positioning Suggested That This Lysine Residue And Its Acetylation Might Contribute To Nucleosome Mobility For Transcription Activation. Further Insights Into Chromatin Regulation Are Expected From This Approach.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Site specificity analysis of Piccolo NuA4-mediated acetylation for different histone complexes. We Have A Limited Understanding Of The Site Specificity Of Multi-Subunit Lysine Acetyltransferase (Kat) Complexes For Histone-Based Substrates, Especially In Regards To The Different Complexes Formed During Nucleosome Assembly. Histone Complexes Could Be A Major Factor In Determining The Acetylation Specificity Of Kats. In The Present Study, We Utilized A Label-Free Quantitative Ms-Based Method To Determine The Site Specificity Of Acetylation Catalysed By Piccolo Nua4 On (H3/H4)2 Tetramer, Tetramer Bound Dna (Tetrasome) And Nucleosome Core Particle (Ncp). Our Results Show That Piccolo Nua4 Can Acetylate Multiple Lysine Residues On These Three Histone Complexes, Of Which Ncp Is The Most Favourable, (H3/H4)2 Tetramer Is The Second And Tetrasome Is The Least Favourable Substrate For Piccolo Nua4 Acetylation. Although Piccolo Nua4 Preferentially Acetylates Histone H4 (H4K12), The Site Specificity Of The Enzyme Is Altered With Different Histone Complex Substrates. Our Results Show That Before Nucleosome Assembly Is Complete, H3K14 Specificity Is Almost Equal To That Of H4K12 And Dna-Histone Interactions Suppress The Acetylation Ability Of Piccolo Nua4. These Data Suggest That The H2A/H2B Dimer Could Play A Critical Role In The Increase In Acetylation Specificity Of Piccolo Nua4 For Ncp. This Demonstrates That Histone Complex Formation Can Alter The Acetylation Preference Of Piccolo Nua4. Such Findings Provide Valuable Insight Into Regulating Piccolo Nua4 Specificity By Modulating Chromatin Dynamics And In Turn Manipulating Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Association of Taf14 with acetylated histone H3 directs gene transcription and the DNA damage response. The Yeats Domain, Found In A Number Of Chromatin-Associated Proteins, Has Recently Been Shown To Have The Capacity To Bind Histone Lysine Acetylation. Here, We Show That The Yeats Domain Of Taf14, A Member Of Key Transcriptional And Chromatin-Modifying Complexes In Yeast, Is A Selective Reader Of Histone H3 Lys9 Acetylation (H3K9Ac). Structural Analysis Reveals That Acetylated Lys9 Is Sandwiched In An Aromatic Cage Formed By F62 And W81. Disruption Of This Binding In Cells Impairs Gene Transcription And The Dna Damage Response. Our Findings Establish A Highly Conserved Acetyllysine Reader Function For The Yeats Domain Protein Family And Highlight The Significance Of This Interaction For Taf14.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The Set3 Complex Antagonizes the MYST Acetyltransferase Esa1 in the DNA Damage Response. Acetylation Is A Dynamic Posttranslational Modification That Contributes To Chromatin-Regulated Processes, Including Dna Replication, Repair, Recombination, And Gene Expression. Acetylation Is Controlled By Complexes Containing Opposing Lysine And Histone Acetyltransferase (Kat And Hat) And Deacetylase (Kdac And Hdac) Activities. The Essential Myst Family Esa1 Kat Acetylates Core Histones And Many Nonhistone Substrates. Phenotypes Of Esa1 Mutants Include Transcriptional Silencing And Activation Defects, Impaired Growth At High Temperatures, And Sensitivity To Dna Damage. The Kdac Rpd3 Was Previously Identified As An Activity Opposing Esa1, As Its Deletion Suppresses Growth And Silencing Defects Of Esa1 Mutants. However, Loss Of Rpd3 Does Not Suppress Esa1 Dna Damage Sensitivity. In This Work, We Identified Hos2 As A Kdac Counteracting Esa1 In The Damage Response. Deletion Of Hos2 Resulted In Changes Of Esa1'S Transcriptional Response Upon Damage. Further, Loss Of Hos2 Or Components Of The Set3 Complex (Set3C) In Which It Acts Specifically Suppressed Damage Sensitivity And Restored Esa1 Histone H4 Acetylation. This Rescue Was Mediated Via Loss Of Either Set3C Integrity Or Of Its Binding To Dimethylated Histone H3K4. Our Results Thus Add New Insight Into The Interactions Of An Essential Myst Acetyltransferase With Diverse Deacetylases To Respond Specifically To Environmental And Physiological Challenges.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A link between Sas2-mediated H4 K16 acetylation, chromatin assembly in S-phase by CAF-I and Asf1, and nucleosome assembly by Spt6 during transcription. The Histone Acetyltransferase Sas2 Is Part Of The Sas-I Complex And Acetylates Lysine 16 Of Histone H4 (H4 K16Ac) In The Genome Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Sas2-Mediated H4 K16Ac Is Strongest Over The Coding Region Of Genes With Low Expression. However, It Is Unclear How Sas2-Mediated Acetylation Is Incorporated Into Chromatin. Our Previous Work Has Shown Physical Interactions Of Sas-I With The Histone Chaperones Caf-I And Asf1, Suggesting A Link Between Sas-I-Mediated Acetylation And Chromatin Assembly. Here, We Find That Sas2-Dependent H4 K16Ac In Bulk Histones Requires Passage Of The Cells Through The S-Phase Of The Cell Cycle, And The Rate Of Increase In H4 K16Ac Depends On Both Caf-I And Asf1, Whereas Steady-State Levels And Genome-Wide Distribution Of H4 K16Ac Show Only Mild Changes In Their Absence. Furthermore, H4 K16Ac Is Deposited In Chromatin At Genes Upon Repression, And This Deposition Requires The Histone Chaperone Spt6, But Not Caf-I, Asf1, Hir Or Rtt106. Altogether, Our Data Indicate That Spt6 Controls H4 K16Ac Levels By Incorporating K16-Unacetylated H4 In Strongly Transcribed Genes. Upon Repression, Spt6 Association Is Decreased, Resulting In Less Deposition Of K16-Unacetylated H4 And Therefore In A Concomitant Increase Of H4 K16Ac That Is Recycled During Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	AtEAF1 is a potential platform protein for Arabidopsis NuA4 acetyltransferase complex. Histone Acetyltransferase Complex Nua4 And Histone Variant Exchanging Complex Swr1 Are Two Chromatin Modifying Complexes Which Act Cooperatively In Yeast And Share Some Intriguing Structural Similarities. Protein Subunits Of Nua4 And Swr1-C Are Highly Conserved Across Eukaryotes, But Form Different Multiprotein Arrangements. For Example, The Human Tip60-P400 Complex Consists Of Homologues Of Both Yeast Nua4 And Swr1-C Subunits, Combining Subunits Necessary For Histone Acetylation And Histone Variant Exchange. It Is Currently Not Known What Protein Complexes Are Formed By The Plant Homologues Of Nua4 And Swr1-C Subunits.We Report On The Identification And Molecular Characterization Of Ateaf1, A New Subunit Of Arabidopsis Nua4 Complex Which Shows Many Similarities To The Platform Protein Of The Yeast Nua4 Complex. Ateaf1 Copurifies With Arabidopsis Homologues Of Nua4 And Swr1-C Subunits Arp4 And Swc4 And Interacts Physically With Atyaf9A And Atyaf9B, Homologues Of The Yaf9 Subunit. Plants Carrying A T-Dna Insertion In One Of The Genes Encoding Ateaf1 Showed Decreased Flc Expression And Early Flowering, Similarly To Atyaf9 Mutants. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analyses Of The Single Mutant Ateaf1B-2 And Artificial Mirna Knock-Down Ateaf1 Lines Showed Decreased Levels Of H4K5 Acetylation In The Promoter Regions Of Major Flowering Regulator Genes, Further Supporting The Role Of Ateaf1 As A Subunit Of The Plant Nua4 Complex.Growing Evidence Suggests That The Molecular Functions Of The Nua4 And Swr1 Complexes Are Conserved In Plants And Contribute Significantly To Plant Development And Physiology. Our Work Provides Evidence For The Existence Of A Yeast-Like Eaf1 Platform Protein In A. Thaliana, Filling An Important Gap In The Knowledge About The Subunit Organization Of The Plant Nua4 Complex.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Eaf1 Links the NuA4 Histone Acetyltransferase Complex to Htz1 Incorporation and Regulation of Purine Biosynthesis. Proper Modulation Of Promoter Chromatin Architecture Is Crucial For Gene Regulation In Order To Precisely And Efficiently Orchestrate Various Cellular Activities. Previous Studies Have Identified The Stimulatory Effect Of The Histone-Modifying Complex Nua4 On The Incorporation Of The Histone Variant H2A.Z (Htz1) At The Pho5 Promoter (A. Auger, L. Galarneau, M. Altaf, A. Nourani, Y. Doyon, R. T. Utley, D. Cronier, S. Allard, And J. Côté, Mol Cell Biol 28:2257-2270, 2008, Http://Dx.Doi.Org/10.1128/Mcb.01755-07). In Vitro Studies With A Reconstituted System Also Indicated An Intriguing Cross Talk Between Nua4 And The H2A.Z-Loading Complex, Swr-C (M. Altaf, A. Auger, J. Monnet-Saksouk, J. Brodeur, S. Piquet, M. Cramet, N. Bouchard, N. Lacoste, R. T. Utley, L. Gaudreau, J. Côté, J Biol Chem 285:15966-15977, 2010, Http://Dx.Doi.Org/10.1074/Jbc.M110.117069). In This Work, We Investigated The Role Of The Nua4 Scaffold Subunit Eaf1 In Global Gene Expression And Genome-Wide Incorporation Of Htz1. We Found That Loss Of Eaf1 Affects Htz1 Levels Mostly At The Promoters That Are Normally Highly Enriched In The Histone Variant. Analysis Of Eaf1 Mutant Cells By Expression Array Unveiled A Relationship Between Nua4 And The Gene Network Implicated In The Purine Biosynthesis Pathway, As Eaf1 Deletion Cripples Induction Of Several Ade Genes. Nua4 Directly Interacts With Bas1 Activation Domain, A Key Transcription Factor Of Adenine Genes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (Chip) Experiments Demonstrate That Nucleosomes On The Inactive Ade17 Promoter Are Acetylated Already By Nua4 And Enriched In Htz1. Upon Derepression, These Poised Nucleosomes Respond Rapidly To Activate Ade Gene Expression In A Mechanism Likely Reminiscent Of The Pho5 Promoter, Leading To Nucleosome Disassembly. These Detailed Molecular Events Depict A Specific Case Of Cross Talk Between Nua4-Dependent Acetylation And Incorporation Of Histone Variant Htz1, Presetting The Chromatin Structure Over Ade Promoters For Subsequent Chromatin Remodeling And Activated Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	High-resolution chromatin dynamics during a yeast stress response. Covalent Histone Modifications Are Highly Conserved And Play Multiple Roles In Eukaryotic Transcription Regulation. Here, We Mapped 26 Histone Modifications Genome-Wide In Exponentially Growing Yeast And During A Dramatic Transcriptional Reprogramming-The Response To Diamide Stress. We Extend Prior Studies Showing That Steady-State Histone Modification Patterns Reflect Genomic Processes, Especially Transcription, And Display Limited Combinatorial Complexity. Interestingly, During The Stress Response We Document A Modest Increase In The Combinatorial Complexity Of Histone Modification Space, Resulting From Roughly 3% Of All Nucleosomes Transiently Populating Rare Histone Modification States. Most Of These Rare Histone States Result From Differences In The Kinetics Of Histone Modification That Transiently Uncouple Highly Correlated Marks, With Slow Histone Methylation Changes Often Lagging Behind The More Rapid Acetylation Changes. Explicit Analysis Of Modification Dynamics Uncovers Ordered Sequences Of Events In Gene Activation And Repression. Together, Our Results Provide A Comprehensive View Of Chromatin Dynamics During A Massive Transcriptional Upheaval.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Conformational flexibility and subunit arrangement of the modular yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex. The Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (Saga) Complex Is A Highly Conserved, 19-Subunit Histone Acetyltransferase Complex That Activates Transcription Through Acetylation And Deubiquitination Of Nucleosomal Histones In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Because Saga Has Been Shown To Display Conformational Variability, We Applied Gradient Fixation To Stabilize Purified Saga And Systematically Analyzed This Flexibility Using Single-Particle Em. Our Two- And Three-Dimensional Studies Show That Saga Adopts Three Major Conformations, And Mutations Of Specific Subunits Affect The Distribution Among These. We Also Located The Four Functional Modules Of Saga Using Electron Microscopy-Based Labeling And Transcriptional Activator Binding Analyses And Show That The Acetyltransferase Module Is Localized In The Most Mobile Region Of The Complex. We Further Comprehensively Mapped The Subunit Interconnectivity Of Saga Using Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometry, Revealing That The Spt And Taf Subunits Form The Structural Core Of The Complex. These Results Provide The Necessary Restraints For Us To Generate A Model Of The Spatial Arrangement Of All Saga Subunits. According To This Model, The Chromatin-Binding Domains Of Saga Are All Clustered In One Face Of The Complex That Is Highly Flexible. Our Results Relate Information Of Overall Saga Structure With Detailed Subunit Level Interactions, Improving Our Understanding Of Its Architecture And Flexibility.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A new companion of elongating RNA Polymerase II: TINTIN, an independent sub-module of NuA4/TIP60 for nucleosome transactions. Multiple Factors Are Involved In The Elongation Stage Of Transcription Regulation To Ensure The Passing Of Rna Polymerases While Preserving Appropriate Nucleosome Structure Thereafter. The Recently Reported Trimeric Sub-Module Of Nua4 Histone Acetyltransferase Complex Involved In This Process Provides More Insight Into The Sophisticated Modulation Of Transcription Elongation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	[SAGA complex: the role in viability and development]. Saga Is A Histone Acetyltransferase Complex, That Cotranscriptionally Performs Histone Modifications And Is Implicated In Regulation Of Gene Expression At The Level Of Changes In Chromatin Structure. Saga Is Also Involved In Mrnp Biogenesis And Export. In This Review, We Examined A Contribution Of Saga And Its Subunits In The Development. We Also Discuss The Diseases Associated With Impaired Activity Of Saga Subunits.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	[The role of multifunctional coactivator complex saga in regulation of eukaryotic gene expression]. Eukaryotic Gene Expression Is Known As A Multistep Process Of High Complexity. Transcription Is One Of Cardinal And Tightly Regulated Phase During Gene Expression. To Provide Accurate And Precise Work Of Gene Regulation Apparatus Including A Plethora Of Modification Of Chromatin Structure And Nucleosome Dynamic Turnover Must Be Occurred. All Transcription Steps Are Under Control Of Large Multiprotein Coactivator Complexes. In This Review We Discuss An Evolutionary Conservative Saga Complex, Which Acetylates And Deubiquitinates Histones During Transcription Activation And Furthermore Is Involved In Subsequent Stages Of Mrnp Biogenesis And Export.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Subnucleosomal structures and nucleosome asymmetry across a genome. Genes Are Packaged Into Nucleosomal Arrays, Each Nucleosome Typically Having Two Copies Of Histones H2A, H2B, H3, And H4. Histones Have Distinct Posttranslational Modifications, Variant Isoforms, And Dynamics. Whether Each Histone Copy Within A Nucleosome Has Distinct Properties, Particularly In Relation To The Direction Of Transcription, Is Unknown. Here We Use Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Exonuclease (Chip-Exo) To Resolve The Organization Of Individual Histones On A Genomic Scale. We Detect Widespread Subnucleosomal Structures In Dynamic Chromatin, Including What Appear To Be Half-Nucleosomes Consisting Of One Copy Of Each Histone. We Also Detect Interactions Of H3 Tails With Linker Dna Between Nucleosomes, Which May Be Negatively Regulated By Methylation Of H3K36. Histone Variant H2A.Z Is Enriched On The Promoter-Distal Half Of The +1 Nucleosome, Whereas H2Bk123 Ubiquitylation And H3K9 Acetylation Are Enriched On The Promoter-Proximal Half In A Transcription-Linked Manner. Subnucleosome Asymmetries Might Serve As Molecular Beacons That Guide Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	AF9 YEATS domain links histone acetylation to DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation. The Recognition Of Modified Histones By "Reader" Proteins Constitutes A Key Mechanism Regulating Gene Expression In The Chromatin Context. Compared With The Great Variety Of Readers For Histone Methylation, Few Protein Modules That Recognize Histone Acetylation Are Known. Here, We Show That The Af9 Yeats Domain Binds Strongly To Histone H3K9 Acetylation And, To A Lesser Extent, H3K27 And H3K18 Acetylation. Crystal Structural Studies Revealed That Af9 Yeats Adopts An Eight-Stranded Immunoglobin Fold And Utilizes A Serine-Lined Aromatic "Sandwiching" Cage For Acetyllysine Readout, Representing A Novel Recognition Mechanism That Is Distinct From That Of Known Acetyllysine Readers. Chip-Seq Experiments Revealed A Strong Colocalization Of Af9 And H3K9 Acetylation Genome-Wide, Which Is Important For The Chromatin Recruitment Of The H3K79 Methyltransferase Dot1L. Together, Our Studies Identified The Evolutionarily Conserved Yeats Domain As A Novel Acetyllysine-Binding Module And Established A Direct Link Between Histone Acetylation And Dot1L-Mediated H3K79 Methylation In Transcription Control.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cell cycle-regulated oscillator coordinates core histone gene transcription through histone acetylation. Dna Replication Occurs During The Synthetic (S) Phase Of The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle And Features A Dramatic Induction Of Histone Gene Expression For Concomitant Chromatin Assembly. Ectopic Production Of Core Histones Outside Of S Phase Is Toxic, Underscoring The Critical Importance Of Regulatory Pathways That Ensure Proper Expression Of Histone Genes. Several Regulators Of Histone Gene Expression In The Budding Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Are Known, Yet The Key Oscillator Responsible For Restricting Gene Expression To S Phase Has Remained Elusive. Here, We Show That Suppressor Of Ty (Spt)10, A Putative Histone Acetyltransferase, And Its Binding Partner Spt21 Are Key Determinants Of S-Phase-Specific Histone Gene Expression. We Show That Spt21 Abundance Is Restricted To S Phase In Part By Anaphase Promoting Complex Cdc20-Homologue 1 (Apc(Cdh1)) And That It Is Recruited To Histone Gene Promoters In S Phase By Spt10. There, Spt21-Spt10 Enables The Recruitment Of A Cascade Of Regulators, Including Histone Chaperones And The Histone-Acetyltransferase General Control Nonderepressible (Gcn) 5, Which We Hypothesize Lead To Histone Acetylation And Consequent Transcription Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The SAGA coactivator complex acts on the whole transcribed genome and is required for RNA polymerase II transcription. The Saga (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase) Coactivator Complex Contains Distinct Chromatin-Modifying Activities And Is Recruited By Dna-Bound Activators To Regulate The Expression Of A Subset Of Genes. Surprisingly, Recent Studies Revealed Little Overlap Between Genome-Wide Saga-Binding Profiles And Changes In Gene Expression Upon Depletion Of Subunits Of The Complex. As Indicators Of Saga Recruitment On Chromatin, We Monitored In Yeast And Human Cells The Genome-Wide Distribution Of Histone H3K9 Acetylation And H2B Ubiquitination, Which Are Respectively Deposited Or Removed By Saga. Changes In These Modifications After Inactivation Of The Corresponding Enzyme Revealed That Saga Acetylates The Promoters And Deubiquitinates The Transcribed Region Of All Expressed Genes. In Agreement With This Broad Distribution, We Show That Saga Plays A Critical Role For Rna Polymerase Ii Recruitment At All Expressed Genes. In Addition, Through Quantification Of Newly Synthesized Rna, We Demonstrated That Saga Inactivation Induced A Strong Decrease Of Mrna Synthesis At All Tested Genes. Analysis Of The Saga Deubiquitination Activity Further Revealed That Saga Acts On The Whole Transcribed Genome In A Very Fast Manner, Indicating A Highly Dynamic Association Of The Complex With Chromatin. Thus, Our Study Uncovers A New Function For Saga As A Bone Fide Cofactor For All Rna Polymerase Ii Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	High-temporal-resolution view of transcription and chromatin states across distinct metabolic states in budding yeast. Under Continuous, Glucose-Limited Conditions, Budding Yeast Exhibit Robust Metabolic Cycles Associated With Major Oscillations Of Gene Expression. How Such Fluctuations Are Linked To Changes In Chromatin Status Is Not Well Understood. Here We Examine The Correlated Genome-Wide Transcription And Chromatin States Across The Yeast Metabolic Cycle At Unprecedented Temporal Resolution, Revealing A 'Just-In-Time Supply Chain' By Which Components From Specific Cellular Processes Such As Ribosome Biogenesis Become Available In A Highly Coordinated Manner. We Identify Distinct Chromatin And Splicing Patterns Associated With Different Gene Categories And Determine The Relative Timing Of Chromatin Modifications Relative To Maximal Transcription. There Is Unexpected Variation In The Chromatin Modification And Expression Relationship, With Histone Acetylation Peaks Occurring With Varying Timing And 'Sharpness' Relative To Rna Expression Both Within And Between Cycle Phases. Chromatin-Modifier Occupancy Reveals Subtly Distinct Spatial And Temporal Patterns Compared To Those Of The Modifications Themselves.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The yeast Cyc8-Tup1 complex cooperates with Hda1p and Rpd3p histone deacetylases to robustly repress transcription of the subtelomeric FLO1 gene. We Demonstrate That The Yeast Flocculation Gene, Flo1, Is Representative Of A Distinct Subset Of Subtelomeric Genes That Are Robustly Repressed By The Cyc8-Tup1 Complex. We Have Examined Cyc8-Tup1 Localisation, Histone Acetylation And Long-Range Chromatin Remodelling Within The Extensive Flo1 Upstream Region. We Show That Cyc8-Tup1 Is Localised In A Dnase I Hypersensitive Site Within An Ordered Array Of Strongly Positioned Nucleosomes Around -700 Base Pairs Upstream Of The Transcription Start Site. In Cyc8 Deletion Mutant Strains, Tup1P Localisation Is Absent, With Concomitant Histone Hyperacetylation Of Adjacent Regions At The Flo1 Promoter. This Is Accompanied By Extensive Histone Depletion Across The Upstream Region And Gene Activation. The Yeast Histone Deacetylases, Hda1P And Rpd3P, Occupy The Repressed Flo1 Promoter Region In A Cyc8-Tup1 Dependent Manner And Coordinate Histone Deacetylation, Nucleosome Stabilisation And Gene Repression. Moreover, We Show That The Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodelling Complex Swi-Snf Occupies The Site Vacated By Cyc8-Tup1 In A Cyc8 Mutant. These Data Suggest That Distinctly Bound Cyc8-Tup1 Cooperates With Hda1P And Rpd3P To Establish Or Maintain An Extensive Array Of Strongly Positioned, Deacetylated Nucleosomes Over The Flo1 Promoter And Upstream Region Which Inhibit Histone Acetylation, Block Swi-Snf Binding And Prevent Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Divergence and selectivity of expression-coupled histone modifications in budding yeasts. Various Histone Modifications Are Widely Associated With Gene Expression, But Their Functional Selectivity At Individual Genes Remains To Be Characterized. Here, We Identify Widespread Differences Between Genome-Wide Patterns Of Two Prominent Marks, H3K9Ac And H3K4Me3, In Budding Yeasts. As Well As Characteristic Gene Profiles, Relative Modification Levels Vary Significantly Amongst Genes, Irrespective Of Expression. Interestingly, We Show That These Differences Couple To Contrasting Features: Higher Methylation To Essential, Periodically Expressed, 'Dpn' (Depleted Proximal Nucleosome) Genes, And Higher Acetylation To Non-Essential, Responsive, 'Opn' (Occupied Proximal Nucleosome) Genes. Thus, H3K4Me3 May Generally Associate With Expression Stability, And H3K9Ac, With Variability. To Evaluate This Notion, We Examine Their Association With Expression Divergence Between The Closely Related Species, S. Cerevisiae And S. Paradoxus. Although Individually Well Conserved At Orthologous Genes, Changes Between Modifications Are Mostly Uncorrelated, Indicating Largely Non-Overlapping Regulatory Mechanisms. Notably, We Find That Inter-Species Differences In Methylation, But Not Acetylation, Are Well Correlated With Expression Changes, Thereby Proposing H3K4Me3 As A Candidate Regulator Of Expression Divergence. Taken Together, Our Results Suggest Distinct Evolutionary Roles For Expression-Linked Modifications, Wherein H3K4Me3 May Contribute To Stabilize Average Expression, Whilst H3K9Ac Associates With More Indirect Aspects Such As Responsiveness.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	High throughput screening identifies modulators of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Previous Studies From Our Laboratory And Others Have Demonstrated That In Addition To Altering Chromatin Acetylation And Conformation, Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (Hdaci) Disrupt The Acetylation Status Of Numerous Transcription Factors And Other Proteins. A Whole Genome Yeast Deletion Library Screen Was Used To Identify Components Of The Transcriptional Apparatus That Modulate The Sensitivity To The Hydroxamic Acid-Based Hdaci, Cg-1521.Screening 4852 Haploid Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Deletion Strains For Sensitivity To Cg-1521 Identifies 407 Sensitive And 80 Resistant Strains. Gene Ontology (Go) Enrichment Analysis Shows That Strains Sensitive To Cg-1521 Are Highly Enriched In Processes Regulating Chromatin Remodeling And Transcription As Well As Other Ontologies, Including Vacuolar Acidification And Vesicle-Mediated Transport. Cg-1521-Resistant Strains Include Those Deficient In The Regulation Of Transcription And Trna Modification. Components Of The Saga Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Complex Are Overrepresented In The Sensitive Strains, Including The Catalytic Subunit, Gcn5. Cell Cycle Analysis Indicates That Both The Wild-Type And Gcn5Δ Strains Show A G1 Delay After Cg-1521 Treatment, However The Gcn5Δ Strain Displays Increased Sensitivity To Cg-1521-Induced Cell Death Compared To The Wild-Type Strain. To Test Whether The Enzymatic Activity Of Gcn5 Is Necessary In The Response To Cg-1521, Growth Assays With A Yeast Strain Expressing A Catalytically Inactive Variant Of The Gcn5 Protein Were Performed And The Results Show That This Strain Is Less Sensitive To Cg-1521 Than The Gcn5Δ Strain.Genome-Wide Deletion Mutant Screening Identifies Biological Processes That Affect The Sensitivity To The Hdac Inhibitor Cg-1521, Including Transcription And Chromatin Remodeling. This Study Illuminates The Pathways Involved In The Response To Cg-1521 In Yeast And Provides Incentives To Understand The Mechanisms Of Hdac Inhibitors In Cancer Cells. The Data Presented Here Demonstrate That Components Of The Saga Complex Are Involved In Mediating The Response To Cg-1521. Additional Experiments Suggest That Functions Other Than The Acetyltransferase Activity Of Gcn5 May Be Sufficient To Attenuate The Effects Of Cg-1521 On Cell Growth.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Eaf5/7/3 form a functionally independent NuA4 submodule linked to RNA polymerase II-coupled nucleosome recycling. The Nua4 Histone Acetyltransferase Complex Is Required For Gene Regulation, Cell Cycle Progression, And Dna Repair. Dissection Of The 13-Subunit Complex Reveals That The Eaf7 Subunit Bridges Eaf5 With Eaf3, A H3K36Me3-Binding Chromodomain Protein, And This Eaf5/7/3 Trimer Is Anchored To Nua4 Through Eaf5. This Trimeric Subcomplex Represents A Functional Module, And A Large Portion Exists In A Native Form Outside The Nua4 Complex. Gene-Specific And Genome-Wide Location Analyses Indicate That Eaf5/7/3 Correlates With Transcription Activity And Is Enriched Over The Coding Region. In Agreement With A Role In Transcription Elongation, The Eaf5/7/3 Trimer Interacts With Phosphorylated Rna Polymerase Ii And Helps Its Progression. Loss Of Eaf5/7/3 Partially Suppresses Intragenic Cryptic Transcription Arising In Set2 Mutants, Supporting A Role In Nucleosome Destabilization. On The Other Hand, Loss Of The Trimer Leads To An Increase Of Replication-Independent Histone Exchange Over The Coding Region Of Transcribed Genes. Taken Together, These Results Lead To A Model Where Eaf5/7/3 Associates With Elongating Polymerase To Promote The Disruption Of Nucleosomes In Its Path, But Also Their Refolding In Its Wake.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Unveiling novel interactions of histone chaperone Asf1 linked to TREX-2 factors Sus1 and Thp1. Anti-Silencing Function 1 (Asf1) Is A Conserved Key Eukaryotic Histone H3/H4 Chaperone That Participates In A Variety Of Dna And Chromatin-Related Processes. These Include The Assembly And Disassembly Of Histones H3 And H4 From Chromatin During Replication, Transcription, And Dna Repair. In Addition, Asf1 Is Required For H3K56 Acetylation Activity Dependent On Histone Acetyltransferase Rtt109. Thus, Asf1 Impacts On Many Aspects Of Dna Metabolism. To Gain Insights Into The Functional Links Of Asf1 With Other Cellular Machineries, We Employed Mass Spectrometry Coupled To Tandem Affinity Purification (Tap) To Investigate Novel Physical Interactions Of Asf1. Under Different Tap-Ms Analysis Conditions, We Describe A New Repertoire Of Asf1 Physical Interactions And Novel Asf1 Post-Translational Modifications As Ubiquitination, Methylation And Acetylation That Open Up New Ways To Regulate Asf1 Functions. Asf1 Co-Purifies With Several Subunits Of The Trex-2, Saga Complexes, And With Nucleoporins Nup2, Nup60, And Nup57, Which Are All Involved In Transcription Coupled To Mrna Export In Eukaryotes. Reciprocally, Thp1 And Sus1 Interact With Asf1. Albeit Mrna Export And Gal1 Transcription Are Not Affected In Asf1Δ A Strong Genetic Interaction Exists Between Asf1 And Sus1. Notably, Supporting A Functional Link Between Asf1 And Trex-2, Both Sus1 And Thp1 Affect The Levels Of Asf1-Dependent Histone H3K56 Acetylation And Histone H3 And H4 Incorporation Onto Chromatin. Additionally, We Provide Evidence For A Role Of Asf1 In Histone H2B Ubiquitination. This Work Proposes A Functional Link Between Asf1 And Trex-2 Components In Histone Metabolism At The Vicinity Of The Nuclear Pore Complex.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Uncoupling transcription from covalent histone modification. It Is Widely Accepted That Transcriptional Regulation Of Eukaryotic Genes Is Intimately Coupled To Covalent Modifications Of The Underlying Chromatin Template, And In Certain Cases The Functional Consequences Of These Modifications Have Been Characterized. Here We Present Evidence That Gene Activation In The Silent Heterochromatin Of The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Can Occur In The Context Of Little, If Any, Covalent Histone Modification. Using A Sir-Regulated Heat Shock-Inducible Transgene, Hsp82-2001, And A Natural Drug-Inducible Subtelomeric Gene, Yfr057W, As Models We Demonstrate That Substantial Transcriptional Induction (>200-Fold) Can Occur In The Context Of Restricted Histone Loss And Negligible Levels Of H3K4 Trimethylation, H3K36 Trimethylation And H3K79 Dimethylation, Modifications Commonly Linked To Transcription Initiation And Elongation. Heterochromatic Gene Activation Can Also Occur With Minimal H3 And H4 Lysine Acetylation And Without Replacement Of H2A With The Transcription-Linked Variant H2A.Z. Importantly, Absence Of Histone Modification Does Not Stem From Reduced Transcriptional Output, Since Hsp82-Δtata, A Euchromatic Promoter Mutant Lacking A Tata Box And With Threefold Lower Induced Transcription Than Heterochromatic Hsp82-2001, Is Strongly Hyperacetylated In Response To Heat Shock. Consistent With Negligible H3K79 Dimethylation, Dot1Δ Cells Lacking H3K79 Methylase Activity Show Unimpeded Occupancy Of Rna Polymerase Ii Within Activated Heterochromatic Promoter And Coding Regions. Our Results Indicate That Large Increases In Transcription Can Be Observed In The Virtual Absence Of Histone Modifications Often Thought Necessary For Gene Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Erasers of histone acetylation: the histone deacetylase enzymes. Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Are Enzymes That Catalyze The Removal Of Acetyl Functional Groups From The Lysine Residues Of Both Histone And Nonhistone Proteins. In Humans, There Are 18 Hdac Enzymes That Use Either Zinc- Or Nad(+)-Dependent Mechanisms To Deacetylate Acetyl Lysine Substrates. Although Removal Of Histone Acetyl Epigenetic Modification By Hdacs Regulates Chromatin Structure And Transcription, Deacetylation Of Nonhistones Controls Diverse Cellular Processes. Hdac Inhibitors Are Already Known Potential Anticancer Agents And Show Promise For The Treatment Of Many Diseases.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Dynamic remodeling of histone modifications in response to osmotic stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specific Histone Modifications Play Important Roles In Chromatin Functions; I.E., Activation Or Repression Of Gene Transcription. This Participation Must Occur As A Dynamic Process. Nevertheless, Most Of The Histone Modification Maps Reported To Date Provide Only Static Pictures That Link Certain Modifications With Active Or Silenced States. This Study, However, Focuses On The Global Histone Modification Variation That Occurs In Response To The Transcriptional Reprogramming Produced By A Physiological Perturbation In Yeast.We Did A Genome-Wide Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis For Eight Specific Histone Modifications Before And After Saline Stress. The Most Striking Change Was Rapid Acetylation Loss In Lysines 9 And 14 Of H3 And In Lysine 8 Of H4, Associated With Gene Repression. The Genes Activated By Saline Stress Increased The Acetylation Levels At These Same Sites, But This Acetylation Process Was Quantitatively Minor If Compared To That Of The Deacetylation Of Repressed Genes. The Changes In The Tri-Methylation Of Lysines 4, 36 And 79 Of H3 And The Di-Methylation Of Lysine 79 Of H3 Were Slighter Than Those Of Acetylation. Furthermore, We Produced New Genome-Wide Maps For Seven Histone Modifications, And We Analyzed, For The First Time In S. Cerevisiae, The Genome-Wide Profile Of Acetylation Of Lysine 8 Of H4.This Research Reveals That The Short-Term Changes Observed In The Post-Stress Methylation Of Histones Are Much More Moderate Than Those Of Acetylation, And That The Dynamics Of The Acetylation State Of Histones During Activation Or Repression Of Transcription Is A Much Quicker Process Than Methylation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Maintenance of heterochromatin boundary and nucleosome composition at promoters by the Asf1 histone chaperone and SWR1-C chromatin remodeler in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Cooperate To Regulate Gene Promoters And To Define Chromatin Neighborhoods. Here, We Identified Genetic And Functional Connections Between Two Silencing-Related Chromatin Factors In The Maintenance Of Native Heterochromatic Structures And Nucleosome Composition At Promoters. Building On A Previously Reported Link Between The Histone Chaperone Asf1 And The Yaf9 Subunit Of The Swr1-C Chromatin Remodeler, We Found That Asf1 Broadly Interacted With Genes Encoding For Swr1-C Subunits. Asf1 And Yaf9 Were Required For Maintaining Expression Of Heterochromatin-Proximal Genes And They Worked Cooperatively To Prevent Repression Of Telomere-Proximal Genes By Limiting The Spread Of Sir Complexes Into Nearby Regions. Genome-Wide Sir2 Profiling, However, Revealed That The Cooperative Heterochromatin Regulation Of Asf1 And Swr1-C Occurred Only On A Subset Of Yeast Telomeres. Extensive Analyses Demonstrated That Formation Of Aberrant Heterochromatin Structures In The Absence Of Asf1 And Yaf9 Was Not Causal For The Pronounced Growth And Transcriptional Defects In Cells Lacking Both These Factors. Instead, Genetic And Molecular Analysis Revealed That H3K56 Acetylation Was Required For Efficient Deposition Of H2A.Z At Subtelomeric And Euchromatic Gene Promoters, Pointing To A Role For Asf1-Dependent H3K56 Acetylation In Swr1-C Biology.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylation of the transcriptional repressor Ume6p allows efficient promoter release and timely induction of the meiotic transient transcription program in yeast. Differentiation Programs Require Strict Spatial And Temporal Control Of Gene Transcription. Genes Expressed During Meiotic Development In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Display Transient Induction And Repression. Early Meiotic Gene (Emg) Repression During Mitosis Is Achieved By Recruiting Both Histone Deacetylase And Chromatin Remodeling Complexes To Their Promoters By The Zinc Cluster Dna Binding Protein Ume6P. Ume6P Repression Is Relieved By Ubiquitin-Mediated Destruction That Is Stimulated By Gcn5P-Induced Acetylation. In This Report, We Demonstrate That Gcn5P Acetylation Of Separate Lysines Within The Zinc Cluster Domain Negatively Impacts Ume6P Dna Binding. Mimicking Lysine Acetylation Using Glutamine Substitution Mutations Decreased Ume6P Binding Efficiency And Resulted In Partial Derepression Of Ume6P-Regulated Genes. Consistent With This Result, Molecular Modeling Predicted That These Lysine Side Chains Are Adjacent To The Dna Phosphate Backbone, Suggesting That Acetylation Inhibits Ume6P Binding By Electrostatic Repulsion. Preventing Acetylation Did Not Impact Final Emg Induction Levels During Meiosis. However, A Delay In Emg Induction Was Observed, Which Became More Severe In Later Expression Classes, Ultimately Resulting In Delayed And Reduced Execution Of The Meiotic Nuclear Divisions. These Results Indicate That Ume6P Acetylation Ensures The Proper Timing Of The Transient Transcription Program During Meiotic Development.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The deacetylase Sir2 from the yeast Clavispora lusitaniae lacks the evolutionarily conserved capacity to generate subtelomeric heterochromatin. Deacetylases Of The Sir2 Or Sirtuin Family Are Thought To Regulate Life Cycle Progression And Life Span In Response To Nutrient Availability. This Family Has Undergone Successive Rounds Of Duplication And Diversification, Enabling The Enzymes To Perform A Wide Variety Of Biological Functions. Two Evolutionarily Conserved Functions Of Yeast Sir2 Proteins Are The Generation Of Repressive Chromatin In Subtelomeric Domains And The Suppression Of Unbalanced Recombination Within The Tandem Rdna Array. Here, We Describe The Function Of The Sir2 Ortholog Clhst1 In The Yeast Clavispora Lusitaniae, An Occasional Opportunistic Pathogen. Clhst1 Was Localized To The Non-Transcribed Spacer Regions Of The Rdna Repeats And Deacetylated Histones At These Loci, Indicating That, Like Other Sir2 Proteins, Clhst1 Modulates Chromatin Structure At The Rdna Repeats. However, We Found No Evidence That Clhst1 Associates With Subtelomeric Regions Or Impacts Gene Expression Directly. This Surprising Observation Highlights The Plasticity Of Sirtuin Function. Related Yeast Species, Including Candida Albicans, Possess An Additional Sir2 Family Member. Thus, It Is Likely That The Ancestral Candida Sir2/Hst1 Gene Was Duplicated And Subfunctionalized, Such That Hst1 Retained The Capacity To Regulate Rdna Whereas Sir2 Had Other Functions, Perhaps Including The Generation Of Subtelomeric Chromatin. After Subsequent Species Diversification, The Sir2 Paralog Was Apparently Lost In The C. Lusitaniae Lineage. Thus, C. Lusitaniae Presents An Opportunity To Discover How Subtelomeric Chromatin Can Be Reconfigured.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The yeast AMPK homolog SNF1 regulates acetyl coenzyme A homeostasis and histone acetylation. Acetyl Coenzyme A (Acetyl-Coa) Is A Key Metabolite At The Crossroads Of Metabolism, Signaling, Chromatin Structure, And Transcription. Concentration Of Acetyl-Coa Affects Histone Acetylation And Links Intermediary Metabolism And Transcriptional Regulation. Here We Show That Snf1, The Budding Yeast Ortholog Of The Mammalian Amp-Activated Protein Kinase (Ampk), Plays A Role In The Regulation Of Acetyl-Coa Homeostasis And Global Histone Acetylation. Snf1 Phosphorylates And Inhibits Acetyl-Coa Carboxylase, Which Catalyzes The Carboxylation Of Acetyl-Coa To Malonyl-Coa, The First And Rate-Limiting Reaction In The De Novo Synthesis Of Fatty Acids. Inactivation Of Snf1 Results In A Reduced Pool Of Cellular Acetyl-Coa, Globally Decreased Histone Acetylation, And Reduced Fitness And Stress Resistance. The Histone Acetylation And Transcriptional Defects Can Be Partially Suppressed And The Overall Fitness Improved In Snf1Δ Mutant Cells By Increasing The Cellular Concentration Of Acetyl-Coa, Indicating That The Regulation Of Acetyl-Coa Homeostasis Represents Another Mechanism In The Snf1 Regulatory Repertoire.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Regulation of the boundaries of accessible chromatin. Regulatory Regions Maintain Nucleosome-Depleted, Open Chromatin Status But Simultaneously Require The Presence Of Nucleosomes For Specific Histone Modifications. It Remains Unclear How These Can Be Achieved For Proper Regulatory Function. Here We Demonstrate That Nucleosomes Positioned Within Accessible Chromatin Regions Near The Boundaries Provide Platforms For Histone Modifications While Preventing The Occlusion Of Regulatory Elements. These Boundary Nucleosomes Were Particularly Enriched For Active Or Poised Regulatory Marks In Human, Such As Histone Acetylations, H3K4 Methylations, H3K9Me3, H3K79Me2, And H4K20Me1. Additionally, We Found That Based On A Genome-Wide Profiling Of ~100 Recombinant Yeast Strains, The Location Of Open Chromatin Borders Tends To Vary Mostly Within 150 Bp Upon Genetic Perturbation Whereas This Positional Variation Increases In Proportion To The Sequence Preferences Of The Underlying Dna For Nucleosome Formation. More Than 40% Of The Local Boundary Shifts Were Associated With Genetic Variation In Cis- Or Trans-Acting Factors. A Sizeable Fraction Of The Identified Genetic Factors Was Also Associated With Nearby Gene Expression, Which Was Correlated With The Distance Between The Transcription Start Site (Tss) And The Boundary That Faces The Tss. Taken Together, The Variation In The Width Of Accessible Chromatin Regions May Arise In Conjunction With The Modulation Of The Boundary Nucleosomes By Post-Translational Modifications Or By Chromatin Regulators And In Association With The Activity Of Nearby Gene Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin remodelers fine-tune H3K36me-directed deacetylation of neighbor nucleosomes by Rpd3S. Chromatin Remodelers Have Been Implicated In The Regulation Of Histone-Modifying Complexes. However, The Underlying Mechanism Remains Poorly Understood. The Rpd3S Histone Deacetylase Complex Is Recruited By Elongating Rna Polymerase Ii To Remove Histone Acetylation At Coding Regions In A Manner That Is Dependent On Methylation Of Lysine 36 On Histone 3 (H3K36Me), And Rpd3S Prefers Dinucleosomes. Here, We Show That The Binding Of Rpd3S To Dinucleosomes And Its Catalytic Activity Are Sensitive To The Length Of Nucleosomal Linker In A Nonlinear Fashion. Intriguingly, We Found That H3K36Me On One Nucleosome Stimulates Rpd3S To Deacetylate The Neighboring Nucleosomes When Those Two Nucleosomes Are Within An Optimal Distance. Finally, We Demonstrate That Chromatin Remodelers Enhance Rpd3S Activity By Altering Nucleosomal Spacing, Suggesting That Chromatin Remodelers Prime Chromatin Configuration To Fine-Tune Subsequent Histone Modification Reactions. This Mechanism Is Important For Accurate Temporal Control Of Chromatin Dynamics During The Transcription Elongation Cycle.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cellular aging is associated with increased ubiquitylation of histone H2B in yeast telomeric heterochromatin. Epigenetic Changes In Chromatin State Are Associated With Aging. Notably, Two Histone Modifications Have Recently Been Implicated In Lifespan Regulation, Namely Acetylation At H4 Lysine 16 In Yeast And Methylation At H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) In Nematodes. However, Less Is Known About Other Histone Modifications. Here, We Report That Cellular Aging Is Associated With Increased Ubiquitylation Of Histone H2B In Yeast Telomeric Heterochromatin. An Increase In Ubiquitylation At Histone H2B Lysine 123 And Methylations At Both H3K4 And H3 Lysine 79 (H3K79) Was Observed At The Telomere-Proximal Regions Of Replicatively Aged Cells, Coincident With Decreased Sir2 Abundance. Moreover, Deficiencies In The H2B Ubiquitylase Complex Rad6/Bre1 As Well As The Deubiquitylase Ubp10 Reduced The Lifespan By Altering Both H3K4 And H3K79 Methylation And Sir2 Recruitment. Thus, These Results Show That Low Levels Of H2B Ubiquitylation Are A Prerequisite For A Normal Lifespan And The Trans-Tail Regulation Of Histone Modifications Regulates Age-Associated Sir2 Recruitment Through Telomeric Silencing.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Yeast phospholipase C is required for normal acetyl-CoA homeostasis and global histone acetylation. Phospholipase C (Plc1P) Is Required For The Initial Step Of Inositol Polyphosphate (Insp) Synthesis, And Yeast Cells With Deletion Of The Plc1 Gene Are Completely Devoid Of Any Insps And Display Aberrations In Transcriptional Regulation. Here We Show That Plc1P Is Required For A Normal Level Of Histone Acetylation; Plc1Δ Cells That Do Not Synthesize Any Insps Display Decreased Acetylation Of Bulk Histones And Global Hypoacetylation Of Chromatin Histones. In Accordance With The Role Of Plc1P In Supporting Histone Acetylation, Plc1Δ Mutation Is Synthetically Lethal With Mutations In Several Subunits Of Saga And Nua4 Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Complexes. Conversely, The Growth Rate, Sensitivity To Multiple Stresses, And The Transcriptional Defects Of Plc1Δ Cells Are Partially Suppressed By Deletion Of Histone Deacetylase Hda1. The Histone Hypoacetylation In Plc1Δ Cells Is Due To The Defect In Degradation Of Repressor Mth1P, And Consequently Lower Expression Of Hxt Genes And Reduced Conversion Of Glucose To Acetyl-Coa, A Substrate For Hats. The Histone Acetylation And Transcriptional Defects Can Be Partially Suppressed And The Overall Fitness Improved In Plc1Δ Cells By Increasing The Cellular Concentration Of Acetyl-Coa. Together, Our Data Indicate That Plc1P And Insps Are Required For Normal Acetyl-Coa Homeostasis, Which, In Turn, Regulates Global Histone Acetylation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Stochastic expression and epigenetic memory at the yeast HO promoter. Eukaryotic Gene Regulation Usually Involves Sequence-Specific Transcription Factors And Sequence-Nonspecific Cofactors. A Large Effort Has Been Made To Understand How These Factors Affect The Average Gene Expression Level Among A Population. However, Little Is Known About How They Regulate Gene Expression In Individual Cells. In This Work, We Address This Question By Mutating Multiple Factors In The Regulatory Pathway Of The Yeast Ho Promoter (Hopr) And Probing The Corresponding Promoter Activity In Single Cells Using Time-Lapse Fluorescence Microscopy. We Show That The Hopr Fires In An "On/Off" Fashion In Wt Cells As Well As In Different Genetic Backgrounds. Many Chromatin-Related Cofactors That Affect The Average Level Of Ho Expression Do Not Actually Affect The Firing Amplitude Of The Hopr; Instead, They Affect The Firing Frequency Among Individual Cell Cycles. With Certain Mutations, The Bimodal Expression Exhibits Short-Term Epigenetic Memory Across The Mitotic Boundary. This Memory Is Propagated In "Cis" And Reflects Enhanced Activator Binding After A Previous "On" Cycle. We Present Evidence That The Memory Results From Slow Turnover Of The Histone Acetylation Marks.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Trichoderma reesei histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 regulates fungal growth, conidiation, and cellulase gene expression. Gcn5 Is A Well-Established Histone Acetyltransferase Involved In Chromatin Modification By Catalyzing The Acetylation Of Specific Lysine Residues Within The N-Terminal Tails Of The Core Histones. To Assess The Role Of Chromatin Remodeling In The Transcriptional Response Of Cellulolytic Trichoderma Reesei To The Changes Of Environmental Conditions, We Identified The T. Reesei Ortholog Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Gcn5 By Sequence Alignment And Functional Analysis. Heterologous Expression Of Trgcn5 In S. Cerevisiae Gcn5Δ Strain Restored The Growth Defect Under Nutrient Limitation As Well As Stresses. In Contrast, Mutant Trgcn5 With Site-Directed Changes Of Residues Critical For Gcn5 Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Could Not Complement The Growth Defect. The T. Reesei Gcn5Δ Mutant Strain Displayed A Strongly Decreased Growth Rate And Dramatic Morphological Changes Including Misshapen Hyphal Cells And Abolished Conidiation. Moreover, The Induced Expression Of Cellulase Genes Was Severely Impaired In The Gcn5Δ T. Reesei With Acetylation Of K9 And K14 Of Histone H3 In The Cellulase Gene Promoter Dramatically Affected In The Absence Of Trgcn5. The Results Indicate That Trgcn5 Plays A Critical Role In Filamentous Growth, Morphogenesis, And Transcriptional Activation Of Specific Genes Including Cellulase Encoding Genes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylation-mediated proteasomal degradation of core histones during DNA repair and spermatogenesis. Histone Acetylation Plays Critical Roles In Chromatin Remodeling, Dna Repair, And Epigenetic Regulation Of Gene Expression, But The Underlying Mechanisms Are Unclear. Proteasomes Usually Catalyze Atp- And Polyubiquitin-Dependent Proteolysis. Here, We Show That The Proteasomes Containing The Activator Pa200 Catalyze The Polyubiquitin-Independent Degradation Of Histones. Most Proteasomes In Mammalian Testes ("Spermatoproteasomes") Contain A Spermatid/Sperm-Specific Α Subunit Α4 S/Psma8 And/Or The Catalytic Β Subunits Of Immunoproteasomes In Addition To Pa200. Deletion Of Pa200 In Mice Abolishes Acetylation-Dependent Degradation Of Somatic Core Histones During Dna Double-Strand Breaks And Delays Core Histone Disappearance In Elongated Spermatids. Purified Pa200 Greatly Promotes Atp-Independent Proteasomal Degradation Of The Acetylated Core Histones, But Not Polyubiquitinated Proteins. Furthermore, Acetylation On Histones Is Required For Their Binding To The Bromodomain-Like Regions In Pa200 And Its Yeast Ortholog, Blm10. Thus, Pa200/Blm10 Specifically Targets The Core Histones For Acetylation-Mediated Degradation By Proteasomes, Providing Mechanisms By Which Acetylation Regulates Histone Degradation, Dna Repair, And Spermatogenesis.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Depletion of cellular iron by curcumin leads to alteration in histone acetylation and degradation of Sml1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Curcumin, A Naturally Occurring Polyphenolic Compound, Is Known To Possess Diverse Pharmacological Properties. There Is A Scarcity Of Literature Documenting The Exact Mechanism By Which Curcumin Modulates Its Biological Effects. In The Present Study, We Have Used Yeast As A Model Organism To Dissect The Mechanism Underlying The Action Of Curcumin. We Found That The Yeast Mutants Of Histone Proteins And Chromatin Modifying Enzymes Were Sensitive To Curcumin And Further Supplementation Of Iron Resulted In Reversal Of The Changes Induced By Curcumin. Additionally, Treatment Of Curcumin Caused The Iron Starvation Induced Expression Of Fet3, Fre1 Genes. We Also Demonstrated That Curcumin Induces Degradation Of Sml1P, A Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor Involved In Regulating Dntps Production. The Degradation Of Sml1P Was Mediated Through Proteasome And Vacuole Dependent Protein Degradation Pathways. Furthermore, Curcumin Exerts Biological Effect By Altering Global Proteome Profile Without Affecting Chromatin Architecture. These Findings Suggest That The Medicinal Properties Of Curcumin Are Largely Contributed By Its Cumulative Effect Of Iron Starvation And Epigenetic Modifications.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Decoupling epigenetic and genetic effects through systematic analysis of gene position. Classic "Position-Effect" Experiments Repositioned Genes Near Telomeres To Demonstrate That The Epigenetic Landscape Can Dramatically Alter Gene Expression. Here, We Show That Systematic Gene Knockout Collections Provide An Exceptional Resource For Interrogating Position Effects, Not Only Near Telomeres But At Every Genetic Locus. Because A Single Reporter Gene Replaces Each Deleted Gene, Interrogating This Reporter Provides A Sensitive Probe Into Different Chromatin Environments While Controlling For Genetic Context. Using This Approach, We Find That, Whereas Systematic Replacement Of Yeast Genes With The Kanmx Marker Does Not Perturb The Chromatin Landscape, Chromatin Differences Associated With Gene Position Account For 35% Of Kanmx Activity. We Observe Distinct Chromatin Influences, Including A Set2/Rpd3-Mediated Antagonistic Interaction Between Histone H3 Lysine 36 Trimethylation And The Rap1 Transcriptional Activation Site In Kanmx. This Interaction Explains Why Some Yeast Genes Have Been Resistant To Deletion And Allows Successful Generation Of These Deletion Strains Through The Use Of A Modified Transformation Procedure. These Findings Demonstrate That Chromatin Regulation Is Not Governed By A Uniform "Histone Code" But By Specific Interactions Between Chromatin And Genetic Factors.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Functional antagonism between Sas3 and Gcn5 acetyltransferases and ISWI chromatin remodelers. Chromatin-Modifying Enzymes And Atp-Dependent Remodeling Complexes Have Been Intensely Studied Individually, Yet How These Activities Are Coordinated To Ensure Essential Cell Functions Such As Transcription, Replication, And Repair Of Damage Is Not Well Understood. In This Study, We Show That The Critical Loss Of Sas3 And Gcn5 Acetyltransferases In Yeast Can Be Functionally Rescued By Inactivation Of Iswi Remodelers. This Genetic Interaction Depends On The Atpase Activities Of Isw1 And Isw2, Suggesting That It Involves Chromatin Remodeling Activities Driven By The Enzymes. Genetic Dissection Of The Isw1 Complexes Reveals That The Antagonistic Effects Are Mediated Specifically By The Isw1A Complex. Loss Of Sas3 And Gcn5 Correlates With Defective Rna Polymerase Ii (Rnapii) Occupancy At Actively Transcribed Genes, As Well As A Significant Loss Of H3K14 Acetylation. Inactivation Of The Isw1A Complex In The Acetyltransferase Mutants Restores Rnapii Recruitment At Active Genes, Indicating That Transcriptional Regulation May Be The Mechanism Underlying Suppression. Dosage Studies And Further Genetic Dissection Reveal That The Isw1B Complex May Act In Suppression Through Down-Regulation Of Isw1A. These Studies Highlight The Importance Of Balanced Chromatin Modifying And Remodeling Activities For Optimal Transcription And Cell Growth.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Suppression analysis of esa1 mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae links NAB3 to transcriptional silencing and nucleolar functions. The Acetyltransferase Esa1 Is Essential In The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Plays A Critical Role In Multiple Cellular Processes. The Most Well-Defined Targets For Esa1 Are Lysine Residues On Histones. However, An Increasing Number Of Nonhistone Proteins Have Recently Been Identified As Substrates Of Esa1. In This Study, Four Genes (Lys20, Leu2, Vap1, And Nab3) Were Identified In A Genetic Screen As High-Copy Suppressors Of The Conditional Temperature-Sensitive Lethality Of An Esa1 Mutant. When Expressed From A High-Copy Plasmid, Each Of These Suppressors Rescued The Temperature-Sensitivity Of An Esa1 Mutant. Only Nab3 Overexpression Also Rescued The Rdna-Silencing Defects Of An Esa1 Mutant. Strengthening The Connections Between Nab3 And Esa1, Mutants Of Nab3 Displayed Several Phenotypes Similar To Those Of Esa1 Mutants, Including Increased Sensitivity To The Topoisomerase I Inhibitor Camptothecin And Defects In Rdna Silencing And Cell-Cycle Progression. In Addition, Nuclear Localization Of Nab3 Was Altered In The Esa1 Mutant. Finally, Posttranslational Acetylation Of Nab3 Was Detected In Vivo And Found To Be Influenced By Esa1.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genetic modifiers of chromatin acetylation antagonize the reprogramming of epi-polymorphisms. Natural Populations Are Known To Differ Not Only In Dna But Also In Their Chromatin-Associated Epigenetic Marks. When Such Inter-Individual Epigenomic Differences (Or "Epi-Polymorphisms") Are Observed, Their Stability Is Usually Not Known: They May Or May Not Be Reprogrammed Over Time Or Upon Environmental Changes. In Addition, Their Origin May Be Purely Epigenetic, Or They May Result From Regulatory Variation Encoded In The Dna. Studying Epi-Polymorphisms Requires, Therefore, An Assessment Of Their Nature And Stability. Here We Estimate The Stability Of Yeast Epi-Polymorphisms Of Chromatin Acetylation, And We Provide A Genome-By-Epigenome Map Of Their Genetic Control. A Transient Epi-Drug Treatment Was Able To Reprogram Acetylation Variation At More Than One Thousand Nucleosomes, Whereas A Similar Amount Of Variation Persisted, Distinguishing "Labile" From "Persistent" Epi-Polymorphisms. Hundreds Of Genetic Loci Underlied Acetylation Variation At 2,418 Nucleosomes Either Locally (In Cis) Or Distantly (In Trans), And This Genetic Control Overlapped Only Partially With The Genetic Control Of Gene Expression. Trans-Acting Regulators Were Not Necessarily Associated With Genes Coding For Chromatin Modifying Enzymes. Strikingly, "Labile" And "Persistent" Epi-Polymorphisms Were Associated With Poor And Strong Genetic Control, Respectively, Showing That Genetic Modifiers Contribute To Persistence. These Results Estimate The Amount Of Natural Epigenomic Variation That Can Be Lost After Transient Environmental Exposures, And They Reveal The Complex Genetic Architecture Of The Dna-Encoded Determinism Of Chromatin Epi-Polymorphisms. Our Observations Provide A Basis For The Development Of Population Epigenetics.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin remodelers Isw1 and Chd1 maintain chromatin structure during transcription by preventing histone exchange. Set2-Mediated Methylation Of Histone H3 Lys36 (H3K36) Is A Mark Associated With The Coding Sequences Of Actively Transcribed Genes, But It Has A Negative Role During Transcription Elongation. It Prevents Trans-Histone Exchange Over Coding Regions And Signals For Histone Deacetylation In The Wake Of Rna Polymerase Ii (Rnapii) Passage. We Have Found That In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae The Isw1B Chromatin-Remodeling Complex Is Specifically Recruited To Open Reading Frames (Orfs) By H3K36 Methylation Through The Pwwp Domain Of Its Ioc4 Subunit In Vivo And In Vitro. Isw1B Acts In Conjunction With Chd1 To Regulate Chromatin Structure By Preventing Trans-Histone Exchange From Taking Place Over Coding Regions. In This Way, Isw1B And Chd1 Are Important In Maintaining Chromatin Integrity During Transcription Elongation By Rnapii.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	In vivo effects of histone H3 depletion on nucleosome occupancy and position in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous Studies In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Established That Depletion Of Histone H4 Results In The Genome-Wide Transcriptional De-Repression Of Hundreds Of Genes. To Probe The Mechanism Of This Transcriptional De-Repression, We Depleted Nucleosomes In Vivo By Conditional Repression Of Histone H3 Transcription. We Then Measured The Resulting Changes In Transcription By Rna-Seq And In Chromatin Organization By Mnase-Seq. This Experiment Also Bears On The Degree To Which Trans-Acting Factors And Dna-Encoded Elements Affect Nucleosome Position And Occupancy In Vivo. We Identified ∼60,000 Nucleosomes Genome Wide, And We Classified ∼2,000 As Having Preferentially Reduced Occupancy Following H3 Depletion And ∼350 As Being Preferentially Retained. We Found That The In Vivo Influence Of Dna Sequences That Favor Or Disfavor Nucleosome Occupancy Increases Following Histone H3 Depletion, Demonstrating That Nucleosome Density Contributes To Moderating The Influence Of Dna Sequence On Nucleosome Formation In Vivo. To Identify Factors Important For Influencing Nucleosome Occupancy And Position, We Compared Our Data To 40 Existing Whole-Genome Data Sets. Factors Associated With Promoters, Such As Histone Acetylation And H2A.Z Incorporation, Were Enriched At Sites Of Nucleosome Loss. Nucleosome Retention Was Linked To Stabilizing Marks Such As H3K36Me2. Notably, The Chromatin Remodeler Isw2 Was Uniquely Associated With Retained Occupancy And Altered Positioning, Consistent With Isw2 Stabilizing Histone-Dna Contacts And Centering Nucleosomes On Available Dna In Vivo. Rna-Seq Revealed A Greater Number Of De-Repressed Genes (∼2,500) Than Previous Studies, And These Genes Exhibited Reduced Nucleosome Occupancy In Their Promoters. In Summary, We Identify Factors Likely To Influence Nucleosome Stability Under Normal Growth Conditions And The Specific Genomic Locations At Which They Act. We Find That Dna-Encoded Nucleosome Stability And Chromatin Composition Dictate Which Nucleosomes Will Be Lost Under Conditions Of Limiting Histone Protein And That This, In Turn, Governs Which Genes Are Susceptible To A Loss Of Regulatory Fidelity.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Expression noise and acetylation profiles distinguish HDAC functions. Gene Expression Shows A Significant Variation (Noise) Between Genetically Identical Cells. Noise Depends On The Gene Expression Process Regulated By The Chromatin Environment. We Screened For Chromatin Factors That Modulate Noise In S. Cerevisiae And Analyzed The Results Using A Theoretical Model That Infers Regulatory Mechanisms From The Noise Versus Mean Relationship. Distinct Activities Of The Rpd3(L) And Set3 Histone Deacetylase Complexes Were Predicted. Both Hdacs Repressed Expression. Yet, Rpd3(L)C Decreased The Frequency Of Transcriptional Bursts, While Set3C Decreased The Burst Size, As Did H2B Monoubiquitination (Ubh2B). We Mapped The Acetylation Of H3 Lysine 9 (H3K9Ac) Upon Deletion Of Multiple Subunits Of Set3C And Rpd3(L)C And Of Ubh2B Effectors. Ubh2B And Set3C Appear To Function In The Same Pathway To Reduce The Probability That An Elongating Polii Produces A Functional Transcript (Polii Processivity), While Rpd3(L)C Likely Represses Gene Expression At A Step Preceding Elongation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	H4K16 acetylation affects recombination and ncRNA transcription at rDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Transcription-Associated Recombination Is An Important Process Involved In Several Aspects Of Cell Physiology. In The Ribosomal Dna (Rdna) Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Rna Polymerase Ii Transcription-Dependent Recombination Has Been Demonstrated Among The Repeated Units. In This Study, We Investigate The Mechanisms Controlling This Process At The Chromatin Level. On The Basis Of A Small Biased Screening, We Found That Mutants Of Histone Deacetylases And Chromatin Architectural Proteins Alter Both The Amount Of Pol Ii-Dependent Noncoding Transcripts And Recombination Products At Rdna In A Coordinated Manner. Of Interest, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analyses In These Mutants Revealed A Corresponding Variation Of The Histone H4 Acetylation Along The Rdna Repeat, Particularly At Lys-16. Here We Provide Evidence That A Single, Rapid, And Reversible Posttranslational Modification-The Acetylation Of The H4K16 Residue-Is Involved In The Coordination Of Transcription And Recombination At Rdna.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetyl-CoA carboxylase regulates global histone acetylation. Histone Acetylation Depends On Intermediary Metabolism For Supplying Acetyl-Coa In The Nucleocytosolic Compartment. However, Because Nucleocytosolic Acetyl-Coa Is Also Used For De Novo Synthesis Of Fatty Acids, Histone Acetylation And Synthesis Of Fatty Acids Compete For The Same Acetyl-Coa Pool. The First And Rate-Limiting Reaction In De Novo Synthesis Of Fatty Acids Is Carboxylation Of Acetyl-Coa To Form Malonyl-Coa, Catalyzed By Acetyl-Coa Carboxylase. In Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Acetyl-Coa Carboxylase Is Encoded By The Acc1 Gene. In This Study, We Show That Attenuated Expression Of Acc1 Results In Increased Acetylation Of Bulk Histones, Globally Increased Acetylation Of Chromatin Histones, And Altered Transcriptional Regulation. Together, Our Data Indicate That Acc1P Activity Regulates The Availability Of Acetyl-Coa For Histone Acetyltransferases, Thus Representing A Link Between Intermediary Metabolism And Epigenetic Mechanisms Of Transcriptional Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Linking yeast Gcn5p catalytic function and gene regulation using a quantitative, graded dominant mutant approach. Establishing Causative Links Between Protein Functional Domains And Global Gene Regulation Is Critical For Advancements In Genetics, Biotechnology, Disease Treatment, And Systems Biology. This Task Is Challenging For Multifunctional Proteins When Relying On Traditional Approaches Such As Gene Deletions Since They Remove All Domains Simultaneously. Here, We Describe A Novel Approach To Extract Quantitative, Causative Links By Modulating The Expression Of A Dominant Mutant Allele To Create A Function-Specific Competitive Inhibition. Using The Yeast Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5P As A Case Study, We Demonstrate The Utility Of This Approach And (1) Find Evidence That Gcn5P Is More Involved In Cell-Wide Gene Repression, Instead Of The Accepted Gene Activation Associated With Hats, (2) Identify Previously Unknown Gene Targets And Interactions For Gcn5P-Based Acetylation, (3) Quantify The Strength Of Some Gcn5P-Dna Associations, (4) Demonstrate That This Approach Can Be Used To Correctly Identify Canonical Chromatin Modifications, (5) Establish The Role Of Acetyltransferase Activity On Synthetic Lethal Interactions, And (6) Identify New Functional Classes Of Genes Regulated By Gcn5P Acetyltransferase Activity--All Six Of These Major Conclusions Were Unattainable By Using Standard Gene Knockout Studies Alone. We Recommend That A Graded Dominant Mutant Approach Be Utilized In Conjunction With A Traditional Knockout To Study Multifunctional Proteins And Generate Higher-Resolution Data That More Accurately Probes Protein Domain Function And Influence.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation pathway is regulated by target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling and functions directly in ribosomal RNA biogenesis. Epigenetic Changes In Chromatin Through Histone Post-Translational Modifications Are Essential For Altering Gene Transcription In Response To Environmental Cues. How Histone Modifications Are Regulated By Environmental Stimuli Remains Poorly Understood Yet This Process Is Critical For Delineating How Epigenetic Pathways Are Influenced By The Cellular Environment. We Have Used The Target Of Rapamycin (Tor) Pathway, Which Transmits Environmental Nutrient Signals To Control Cell Growth, As A Model To Delineate Mechanisms Underlying This Phenomenon. A Chemical Genomics Screen Using The Tor Inhibitor Rapamycin Against A Histone H3/H4 Mutant Library Identified Histone H3 Lysine 56 Acetylation (H3K56Ac) As A Chromatin Modification Regulated By Tor Signaling. We Demonstrate This Acetylation Pathway Functions In Tor-Dependent Cell Growth In Part By Contributing Directly To Ribosomal Rna (Rrna) Biogenesis. Specifically, H3K56Ac Creates A Chromatin Environment Permissive To Rna Polymerase I Transcription And Nascent Rrna Processing By Regulating Binding Of The High Mobility Group Protein Hmo1 And The Small Ribosomal Subunit (Ssu) Processome Complex. Overall, These Studies Identify A Novel Chromatin Regulatory Role For Tor Signaling And Support A Specific Function For H3K56Ac In Ribosomal Dna (Rdna) Gene Transcription And Nascent Rrna Processing Essential For Cell Growth.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	ATAC-king the complexity of SAGA during evolution. The Yeast Saga (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) Coactivator Complex Exerts Functions In Gene Expression, Including Activator Interaction, Histone Acetylation, Histone Deubiquitination, Mrna Export, Chromatin Recognition, And Regulation Of The Basal Transcription Machinery. These Diverse Functions Involve Distinct Modules Within This Multiprotein Complex. It Has Now Become Clear That Yeast Saga Has Diverged During Metazoan Evolution Into Two Related Complexes, Saga And Atac, Which Exist In Two Flavors In Vertebrates. The Compositions Of Metazoan Atac And Saga Complexes Have Been Characterized, And Functional Analyses Indicate That These Complexes Have Important But Distinct Roles In Transcription, Histone Modification, Signaling Pathways, And Cell Cycle Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Paf1 restricts Gcn4 occupancy and antisense transcription at the ARG1 promoter. The Conserved Paf1 Complex Negatively Regulates The Expression Of Numerous Genes, Yet The Mechanisms By Which It Represses Gene Expression Are Not Well Understood. In This Study, We Use The Arg1 Gene As A Model To Investigate The Repressive Functions Of The Paf1 Complex In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Our Results Indicate That Paf1 Mediates Repression Of The Arg1 Gene Independently Of The Gene-Specific Repressor, Argr/Mcm1. Rather, By Promoting Histone H2B Lysine 123 Ubiquitylation, Paf1 Represses The Arg1 Gene By Negatively Affecting Gcn4 Occupancy At The Promoter. Consistent With This Observation, Gcn5 And Its Acetylation Sites On Histone H3 Are Required For Full Arg1 Derepression In Paf1Δ Cells, And The Repressive Effect Of Paf1 Is Largely Maintained When The Arg1 Promoter Directs Transcription Of A Heterologous Coding Region. Derepression Of The Arg1 Gene In Paf1Δ Cells Is Accompanied By Small Changes In Nucleosome Occupancy, Although These Changes Are Subtle In Comparison To Those That Accompany Gene Activation Through Amino Acid Starvation. Additionally, Conditions That Stimulate Arg1 Transcription, Including Paf1 Deletion, Lead To Increased Antisense Transcription Across The Arg1 Promoter. This Promoter-Associated Antisense Transcription Positively Correlates With Arg1 Sense Transcription. Finally, Our Results Indicate That Paf1 Represses Other Genes Through Mechanisms Similar To Those Used At The Arg1 Gene.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Promoter regulation by distinct mechanisms of functional interplay between lysine acetylase Rtt109 and histone chaperone Asf1. The Promoter Activity Of Yeast Genes Can Depend On Lysine 56 (K56) Acetylation Of Histone H3. This Modification Of H3 Is Performed By Lysine Acetylase Rtt109 Acting In Concert With Histone Chaperone Asf1. We Have Examined The Contributions Of Rtt109, Asf1, And H3 K56 Acetylation To Nutrient Regulation Of A Well-Studied Metabolic Gene, Arg1. As Expected, Rtt109, Asf1, And H3 K56 Acetylation Are Required For Maximal Transcription Of Arg1 Under Inducing Conditions. However, Rtt109 And Asf1 Also Inhibit Arg1 Under Repressing Conditions. This Inhibition Requires Asf1 Binding To H3-H4 And Rtt109 Kat Activity, But Not Tail Acetylation Of H3-H4 Or K56 Acetylation Of H3. These Observations Suggest The Existence Of A Unique Mechanism Of Transcriptional Regulation By Rtt109. Indeed, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation And Genetic Interaction Studies Support A Model In Which Promoter-Targeted Rtt109 Represses Arg1 By Silencing A Pathway Of Transcriptional Activation That Depends On Asf1. Collectively, Our Results Show That Arg1 Transcription Intensity At Its Induced And Repressed Set Points Is Controlled By Different Mechanisms Of Functional Interplay Between Rtt109 And Asf1.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide analysis of chromatin features identifies histone modification sensitive and insensitive yeast transcription factors. We Propose A Method To Predict Yeast Transcription Factor Targets By Integrating Histone Modification Profiles With Transcription Factor Binding Motif Information. It Shows Improved Predictive Power Compared To A Binding Motif-Only Method. We Find That Transcription Factors Cluster Into Histone-Sensitive And -Insensitive Classes. The Target Genes Of Histone-Sensitive Transcription Factors Have Stronger Histone Modification Signals Than Those Of Histone-Insensitive Ones. The Two Classes Also Differ In Tendency To Interact With Histone Modifiers, Degree Of Connectivity In Protein-Protein Interaction Networks, Position In The Transcriptional Regulation Hierarchy, And In A Number Of Additional Features, Indicating Possible Differences In Their Transcriptional Regulation Mechanisms.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide integration on transcription factors, histone acetylation and gene expression reveals genes co-regulated by histone modification patterns. N-Terminal Tails Of H2A, H2B, H3 And H4 Histone Families Are Subjected To Posttranslational Modifications That Take Part In Transcriptional Regulation Mechanisms, Such As Transcription Factor Binding And Gene Expression. Regulation Mechanisms Under Control Of Histone Modification Are Important But Remain Largely Unclear, Despite Of Emerging Datasets For Comprehensive Analysis Of Histone Modification. In This Paper, We Focus On What We Call Genetic Harmonious Units (Ghus), Which Are Co-Occurring Patterns Among Transcription Factor Binding, Gene Expression And Histone Modification. We Present The First Genome-Wide Approach That Captures Ghus By Combining Chip-Chip With Microarray Datasets From Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Our Approach Employs Noise-Robust Soft Clustering To Select Patterns Which Share The Same Preferences In Transcription Factor-Binding, Histone Modification And Gene Expression, Which Are All Currently Implied To Be Closely Correlated. The Detected Patterns Are A Well-Studied Acetylation Of Lysine 16 Of H4 In Glucose Depletion As Well As Co-Acetylation Of Five Lysine Residues Of H3 With H4 Lys12 And H2A Lys7 Responsible For Ribosome Biogenesis. Furthermore, Our Method Further Suggested The Recognition Of Acetylated H4 Lys16 Being Crucial To Histone Acetyltransferase Esa1, Whose Essential Role Is Still Under Controversy, From A Microarray Dataset On Esa1 And Its Bypass Suppressor Mutants. These Results Demonstrate That Our Approach Allows Us To Provide Clearer Principles Behind Gene Regulation Mechanisms Under Histone Modifications And Detect Ghus Further By Applying To Other Microarray And Chip-Chip Datasets. The Source Code Of Our Method, Which Was Implemented In Matlab (Http://Www.Mathworks.Com/), Is Available From The Supporting Page For This Paper: Http://Www.Bic.Kyoto-U.Ac.Jp/Pathway/Natsume/Hm_Detector.Htm.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Tup1 stabilizes promoter nucleosome positioning and occupancy at transcriptionally plastic genes. Despite Technical Advances, The Future Of Chromatin Mapping Studies Requires An Ability To Draw Accurate Comparisons Between Different Chromatin States To Enhance Our Understanding Of Genome Biology. In This Study, We Used Matched Chromatin Preparations To Enable Specific And Accurate Comparisons Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Chromatin Structures In The Presence And Absence Of The Co-Repressor Protein Tup1. Analysis Of Wild-Type And Tup1 Δ Chromatin Data Sets Revealed Unique Organizational Themes Relating To The Function Of Tup1. Regulatory Regions Bound By Tup1 Assumed A Distinct Chromatin Architecture Composed Of A Wide Nucleosome-Depleted Region, Low Occupancy/Poorly Positioned Promoter Nucleosomes, A Larger Number And Wider Distribution Of Transcription Factor-Binding Sites And Downstream Genes With Enhanced Transcription Plasticity. Regions Of Tup1-Dependent Chromatin Structure Were Defined For The First Time Across The Entire Yeast Genome And Are Shown To Strongly Overlap With Activity Of The Chromatin Remodeler Isw2. Additionally, Tup1-Dependent Chromatin Structures Are Shown To Relate To Distinct Biological Processes And Transcriptional States Of Regulated Genes, Including Tup1 Stabilization Of Minus 1 And Minus 2 Promoter Nucleosomes At Actively Repressed Genes. Together These Results Help To Enhance Our Mechanistic Understanding Of Tup1 Regulation Of Chromatin Structure And Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometric analysis of the acetylation state of histones H3 and H4 in stationary phase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Involvement Of Histone Acetylation In Facilitating Gene Expression Is Well-Established, Particularly In The Case Of Histones H3 And H4. It Was Previously Shown In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae That Gene Expression Was Significantly Down-Regulated And Chromatin More Condensed In Stationary Phase Compared To Exponential Phase. We Were Therefore Interested In Establishing The Acetylation State Of Histone H3 And H4 In Stationary And In Exponential Phase, Since The Regulation Of This Modification Could Contribute To Transcriptional Shut-Down And Chromatin Compaction During Semi-Quiescence.We Made Use Of Nano-Spray Tandem Mass Spectrometry To Perform A Precursor Ion Scan To Detect An M/Z 126 Immonium Ion, Diagnostic Of An Nε-Acetylated Lysine Residue That Allowed Unambiguous Identification Of Acetylated As Opposed To Tri-Methylated Lysine. The Fragmentation Spectra Of Peptides Thus Identified Were Searched With Mascot Against The Swiss-Prot Database, And The Y-Ion And B-Ion Fragmentation Series Subsequently Analyzed For Mass Shifts Compatible With Acetylated Lysine Residues. We Found That K9, K14 And K36 Of Histone H3 And K12 And K16 Of Histone H4 Were Acetylated In Exponential Phase (Bulk Histones), But Could Not Detect These Modifications In Histones Isolated From Stationary Phase Cells At The Sensitivity Level Of The Mass Spectrometer. The Corresponding Un-Acetylated Peptides Were, However, Observed. A Significantly Higher Level Of Acetylation Of These Residues In Exponential Phase Was Confirmed By Immuno-Blotting.H4K16 Acetylation Was Previously Shown To Disrupt Formation Of Condensed Chromatin In Vitro. We Propose That De-Acetylation Of H4K16 Allowed Formation Of Condensed Chromatin In Stationary Phase, And That Acetylation Of H3K9, H3K14, H3K36, And H4K12 Reflected The Active Transcriptional State Of The Yeast Genome In Exponential Phase.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Sgf29 binds histone H3K4me2/3 and is required for SAGA complex recruitment and histone H3 acetylation. The Saga (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase) Complex Is An Important Chromatin Modifying Complex That Can Both Acetylate And Deubiquitinate Histones. Sgf29 Is A Novel Component Of The Saga Complex. Here, We Report The Crystal Structures Of The Tandem Tudor Domains Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Human Sgf29 And Their Complexes With H3K4Me2 And H3K4Me3 Peptides, Respectively, And Show That Sgf29 Selectively Binds H3K4Me2/3 Marks. Our Crystal Structures Reveal That Sgf29 Harbours Unique Tandem Tudor Domains In Its C-Terminus. The Tandem Tudor Domains In Sgf29 Tightly Pack Against Each Other Face-To-Face With Each Tudor Domain Harbouring A Negatively Charged Pocket Accommodating The First Residue Alanine And Methylated K4 Residue Of Histone H3, Respectively. The H3A1 And K4Me3 Binding Pockets And The Limited Binding Cleft Length Between These Two Binding Pockets Are The Structural Determinants In Conferring The Ability Of Sgf29 To Selectively Recognize H3K4Me2/3. Our In Vitro And In Vivo Functional Assays Show That Sgf29 Recognizes Methylated H3K4 To Recruit The Saga Complex To Its Targets Sites And Mediates Histone H3 Acetylation, Underscoring The Importance Of Sgf29 In Gene Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	H3 lysine 4 is acetylated at active gene promoters and is regulated by H3 lysine 4 methylation. Methylation Of Histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4Me) Is An Evolutionarily Conserved Modification Whose Role In The Regulation Of Gene Expression Has Been Extensively Studied. In Contrast, The Function Of H3K4 Acetylation (H3K4Ac) Has Received Little Attention Because Of A Lack Of Tools To Separate Its Function From That Of H3K4Me. Here We Show That, In Addition To Being Methylated, H3K4 Is Also Acetylated In Budding Yeast. Genetic Studies Reveal That The Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) Gcn5 And Rtt109 Contribute To H3K4 Acetylation In Vivo. Whilst Removal Of H3K4Ac From Euchromatin Mainly Requires The Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Hst1, Sir2 Is Needed For H3K4 Deacetylation In Heterochomatin. Using Genome-Wide Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (Chip), We Show That H3K4Ac Is Enriched At Promoters Of Actively Transcribed Genes And Located Just Upstream Of H3K4 Tri-Methylation (H3K4Me3), A Pattern That Has Been Conserved In Human Cells. We Find That The Set1-Containing Complex (Compass), Which Promotes H3K4Me2 And -Me3, Also Serves To Limit The Abundance Of H3K4Ac At Gene Promoters. In Addition, We Identify A Group Of Genes That Have High Levels Of H3K4Ac In Their Promoters And Are Inadequately Expressed In H3-K4R, But Not In Set1Δ Mutant Strains, Suggesting That H3K4Ac Plays A Positive Role In Transcription. Our Results Reveal A Novel Regulatory Feature Of Promoter-Proximal Chromatin, Involving Mutually Exclusive Histone Modifications Of The Same Histone Residue (H3K4Ac And H3K4Me).
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Mediator influences telomeric silencing and cellular life span. The Mediator Complex Is Required For The Regulated Transcription Of Nearly All Rna Polymerase Ii-Dependent Genes. Here We Demonstrate A New Role For Mediator Which Appears To Be Separate From Its Function As A Transcriptional Coactivator. Mediator Associates Directly With Heterochromatin At Telomeres And Influences The Exact Boundary Between Active And Inactive Chromatin. Loss Of The Mediator Med5 Subunit Or Mutations In Med7 Cause A Depletion Of The Complex From Regions Located Near Subtelomeric X Elements, Which Leads To A Change In The Balance Between The Sir2 And Sas2 Proteins. These Changes In Turn Result In Increased Levels Of H4K16 Acetylation Near Telomeres And In Desilencing Of Subtelomeric Genes. Increases In H4K16 Acetylation Have Been Observed At Telomeres In Aging Cells. In Agreement With This Observation, We Found That The Loss Of Med5 Leads To Shortening Of The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Budding Yeast) Replicative Life Span.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Differential contributions of histone H3 and H4 residues to heterochromatin structure. Transcriptional Silencing In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Is Mediated By Heterochromatin. There Is A Plethora Of Information Regarding The Roles Of Histone Residues In Transcriptional Silencing, But Exactly How Histone Residues Contribute To Heterochromatin Structure Is Not Resolved. We Address This Question By Testing The Effects Of A Series Of Histone H3 And H4 Mutations Involving Residues In Their Aminoterminal Tails, On The Solvent-Accessible And Lateral Surfaces Of The Nucleosome, And At The Interface Of The H3/H4 Tetramer And H2A/H2B Dimer On Heterochromatin Structure And Transcriptional Silencing. The General State, Stability, And Conformational Heterogeneity Of Chromatin Are Examined With A Dna Topology-Based Assay, And The Primary Chromatin Structure Is Probed By Micrococcal Nuclease. We Demonstrate That The Histone Mutations Differentially Affect Heterochromatin. Mutations Of Lysine 16 Of Histone H4 (H4-K16) And Residues In The Lrs (Loss Of Rdna Silencing) Domain Of Nucleosome Surface Markedly Alter Heterochromatin Structure, Supporting The Notion That H4-K16 And Lrs Play Key Roles In Heterochromatin Formation. Deletion Of The Aminoterminal Tail Of H3 Moderately Alters Heterochromatin Structure. Interestingly, A Group Of Mutations In The Globular Domains Of H3 And H4 That Abrogate Or Greatly Reduce Transcriptional Silencing Increase The Conformational Heterogeneity And/Or Reduce The Stability Of Heterochromatin Without Affecting Its Overall Structure. Surprisingly, Yet Another Series Of Mutations Abolish Or Reduce Silencing Without Significantly Affecting The Structure, Stability, Or Conformational Heterogeneity Of Heterochromatin. Therefore, Histone Residues May Contribute To The Structure, Stability, Conformational Heterogeneity, Or Other Yet-To-Be-Characterized Features Of Heterochromatin Important For Transcriptional Silencing.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Activator-independent transcription of Snf1-dependent genes in mutants lacking histone tails. Transcriptional Regulation Of Snf1-Dependent Genes Occurs In Part By Histone-Acetylation-Dependent Binding Of The Transcription Factor Adr1. Analysis Of Previously Published Microarray Data Indicated Unscheduled Transcription Of A Large Number Of Snf1- And Adr1-Dependent Genes When Either The Histone H3 Or H4 Tail Was Deleted. Quantitative Real-Time Pcr Confirmed That The Tails Were Important To Preserve Stringent Transcriptional Repression Of Snf1-Dependent Genes When Glucose Was Present. The Absence Of The Tails Allowed Adr1 And Rna Polymerase Ii To Bind Promoters In Normally Inhibitory Conditions. The Promoters Escaped Glucose Repression To A Limited Extent And The Weak Constitutive Adh2 Transcription Induced By Deletion Of The Histone Tails Was Transcription Factor- And Snf1-Independent. These Effects Were Apparently Due To A Permissive Chromatin Structure That Allowed Transcription In The Absence Of Repression Mediated By The Histone Tails. Deleting Reg1, And Thus Activating Snf1 In The H3 Tail Mutant Enhanced Transcription In Repressing Conditions, Indicating That Snf1 And The H3 Tail Influence Transcription Independently. Deleting Reg1 In The Histone H4 Tail Mutant Appeared To Be Lethal, Even In The Absence Of Snf1, Suggesting That Reg1 And The H4 Tail Have Redundant Functions That Are Important For Cell Viability.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Interaction between nucleosome assembly protein 1-like family members. Mammals Possess Five Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1-Like (Nap1L) Proteins, With Three Of Them Being Expressed Exclusively In The Nervous System. The Biological Importance Of The Neuron-Specific Nap1L2 Protein Is Demonstrated By The Neural Tube Defects Occurring During The Embryonic Development Of Nap1L2 Mutant Mice, Which Are Associated With An Overproliferation Of Neural Stem Cells And Decreased Neuronal Differentiation. Nap1L2 Controls The Expression Of Its Target Genes, Such As The Cell Cycle Regulator Cdkn1C, At Least In Part Via An Effect On Histone Acetylation. Using A Two-Hybrid Analysis, We Have Identified Several Proteins Interacting With Nap1L2, Including The Ubiquitously Expressed Members Of The Nucleosome Assembly Protein Family, Nap1L1 And Nap1L4. Structural Studies Further Predict That All Five Nap1-Like Proteins Are Able To Interact Directly Via Their Highly Conserved Α-Helices. These Elements, In Conjunction With The Coexpression Of All The Nap1-Like Proteins In Neurons And The Finding That Deletion Of Nap1L2 Affects The Cytoplasmic-Nuclear Distribution Patterns Of Both Nap1L1 And Nap1L4 And Their Recruitment To Target Genes, Suggest That Combinatorial Variation Within The Nap Family May Ensure Adaptation To The Specific Requirements For Neuronal Differentiation Such As Intercellular Repartition, Chromatin Modification, Transcriptional Regulation, Or The Recruitment Of Specific Transcription Factors.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The histone H3K36 demethylase Rph1/KDM4 regulates the expression of the photoreactivation gene PHR1. The Dynamics Of Histone Methylation Have Emerged As An Important Issue Since The Identification Of Histone Demethylases. We Studied The Regulatory Function Of Rph1/Kdm4 (Lysine Demethylase), A Histone H3K36 Demethylase, On Transcription In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Overexpression Of Rph1 Reduced The Expression Of Phr1 And Increased Uv Sensitivity. The Catalytically Deficient Mutant (H235A) Of Rph1 Diminished The Repressive Transcriptional Effect On Phr1 Expression, Which Indicates That Histone Demethylase Activity Contributes To Transcriptional Repression. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis Demonstrated That Rph1 Was Associated At The Upstream Repression Sequence Of Phr1 Through Zinc-Finger Domains And Was Dissociated After Uv Irradiation. Notably, Overexpression Of Rph1 And H3K36A Mutant Reduced Histone Acetylation At The Urs, Which Implies A Crosstalk Between Histone Demethylation And Acetylation At The Phr1 Promoter. In Addition, The Crucial Checkpoint Protein Rad53 Acted As An Upstream Regulator Of Rph1 And Dominated The Phosphorylation Of Rph1 That Was Required For Efficient Phr1 Expression And The Dissociation Of Rph1. The Release Of Rph1 From Chromatin Also Required The Phosphorylation At S652. Our Study Demonstrates That The Histone Demethylase Rph1 Is Associated With A Specific Chromatin Locus And Modulates Histone Modifications To Repress A Dna Damage Responsive Gene Under Control Of Damage Checkpoint Signaling.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Structure of the Rtt109-AcCoA/Vps75 complex and implications for chaperone-mediated histone acetylation. Yeast Rtt109 Promotes Nucleosome Assembly And Genome Stability By Acetylating K9, K27, And K56 Of Histone H3 Through Interaction With Either Of Two Distinct Histone Chaperones, Vps75 Or Asf1. We Report The Crystal Structure Of An Rtt109-Accoa/Vps75 Complex Revealing An Elongated Vps75 Homodimer Bound To Two Globular Rtt109 Molecules To Form A Symmetrical Holoenzyme With A ∼12 Å Diameter Central Hole. Vps75 And Rtt109 Residues That Mediate Complex Formation In The Crystals Are Also Important For Rtt109-Vps75 Interaction And H3K9/K27 Acetylation Both In Vitro And In Yeast Cells. The Same Rtt109 Residues Do Not Participate In Asf1-Mediated Rtt109 Acetylation In Vitro Or H3K56 Acetylation In Yeast Cells, Demonstrating That Asf1 And Vps75 Dictate Rtt109 Substrate Specificity Through Distinct Mechanisms. These Studies Also Suggest That Vps75 Binding Stimulates Rtt109 Catalytic Activity By Appropriately Presenting The H3-H4 Substrate Within The Central Cavity Of The Holoenzyme To Promote H3K9/K27 Acetylation Of New Histones Before Deposition.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Transcriptional regulation by Asf1: new mechanistic insights from studies of the DNA damage response to replication stress. Asf1 Is A Conserved Histone H3/H4 Chaperone. We Find That Asf1 In Budding Yeast Promotes An Essential Cellular Response To Replication Stress Caused By The Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor Hydroxyurea. That Is, Asf1 Stimulates Derepression Of Dna Damage Response (Ddr) Genes During The S Phase. Derepression Of Ddr Genes Strongly Correlates With Asf1 Binding To Their Promoters. Having Identified The C Terminus And Histone-Binding Domains Of Asf1 As Molecular Determinants Of Its Constitutive And Inducible Association With Chromatin, We Tested Whether Asf1 Binding To Ddr Genes Is Mechanistically Important For Their Derepression. Our Results Provide Little Support For This Hypothesis. Rather, The Contribution Of Asf1 To Ddr Gene Derepression Depends On Its Ability To Stimulate H3K56 Acetylation By Lysine Acetyltransferase Rtt109. The Precise Regulation Of H3K56 Acetylation In The Promoters Of Ddr Genes Is Unexpected: Ddr Gene Promoters Are Occupied By H3K56-Acetylated Nucleosomes Under Repressing Conditions, And The Steady State Level Of H3K56 Promoter Acetylation Does Not Change Upon Derepression. We Propose That Replication-Coupled Deposition Of Lys(56)-Acetylated H3 Poises The Ddr Genes In Newly Synthesized Daughter Duplexes For Derepression During The S Phase. In This Model, The Presence Of A Histone Mark That Destabilizes Nucleosomes Is Compatible With Suppression Of Transcription Because In The Uninduced State, Ddr Gene Promoters Are Constitutively Occupied By A Potent Repressor-Corepressor Complex.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A novel mammalian complex containing Sin3B mitigates histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II progression within transcribed loci. Transcription Requires The Progression Of Rna Polymerase Ii (Rnap Ii) Through A Permissive Chromatin Structure. Recent Studies Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Have Demonstrated That The Yeast Sin3 Protein Contributes To The Restoration Of The Repressed Chromatin Structure At Actively Transcribed Loci. Yet, The Mechanisms Underlying The Restoration Of The Repressive Chromatin Structure At Transcribed Loci And Its Significance In Gene Expression Have Not Been Investigated In Mammals. We Report Here The Identification Of A Mammalian Complex Containing The Corepressor Sin3B, The Histone Deacetylase Hdac1, Mrg15, And The Phd Finger-Containing Pf1 And Show That This Complex Plays Important Roles In Regulation Of Transcription. We Demonstrate That This Complex Localizes At Discrete Loci Approximately 1 Kb Downstream Of The Transcription Start Site Of Transcribed Genes, And This Localization Requires Both Pf1'S And Mrg15'S Interaction With Chromatin. Inactivation Of This Mammalian Complex Promotes Increased Rnap Ii Progression Within Transcribed Regions And Subsequent Increased Transcription. Our Results Define A Novel Mammalian Complex That Contributes To The Regulation Of Transcription And Point To Divergent Uses Of The Sin3 Protein Homologues Throughout Evolution In The Modulation Of Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide analysis of the effect of histone modifications on the coexpression of neighboring genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Neighboring Gene Pairs In The Genome Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Have A Tendency To Be Expressed At The Same Time. The Distribution Of Histone Modifications Along Chromatin Fibers Is Suggested To Be An Important Mechanism Responsible For Such Coexpression. However, The Extent Of The Contribution Of Histone Modifications To The Coexpression Of Neighboring Genes Is Unclear.We Investigated The Similarity Of Histone Modification Between Neighboring Genes Using Autocorrelation Analysis And Composite Profiles. Our Analysis Showed That Neighboring Genes Had Similar Levels Or Changes Of Histone Modifications, Especially Those Transcribed In The Same Direction. The Similarities, However, Were Restricted To 1 Or 2 Neighboring Genes. Moreover, The Expression Of A Gene Was Significantly Correlated With Histone Modification Of Its Neighboring Gene(S), But This Was Limited To Only 1 Or 2 Neighbors. Using A Hidden Markov Model (Hmm), We Found More Than 2000 Chromatin Domains With Similar Acetylation Changes As The Cultures Changed And A Considerable Number Of These Domains Covered 2-4 Genes. Gene Pairs Within Domains Exhibited A Higher Level Of Coexpression Than Random Pairs And Shared Similar Functions.The Results Of This Study Suggest That Similar Histone Modifications Occur Within Only A Small Local Chromatin Region In Yeast. The Modifications Generally Have An Effect On Coexpression With Only 1 Or 2 Neighboring Genes. Some Blocking Mechanism(S) Might Strictly Restrain The Distribution Of Histone Modifications In Yeast.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Elevated histone expression promotes life span extension. Changes To The Chromatin Structure Accompany Aging, But The Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Aging And The Accompanying Changes To The Chromatin Are Unclear. Here, We Report A Mechanism Whereby Altering Chromatin Structure Regulates Life Span. We Show That Normal Aging Is Accompanied By A Profound Loss Of Histone Proteins From The Genome. Indeed, Yeast Lacking The Histone Chaperone Asf1 Or Acetylation Of Histone H3 On Lysine 56 Are Short Lived, And This Appears To Be At Least Partly Due To Their Having Decreased Histone Levels. Conversely, Increasing The Histone Supply By Inactivation Of The Histone Information Regulator (Hir) Complex Or Overexpression Of Histones Dramatically Extends Life Span Via A Pathway That Is Distinct From Previously Known Pathways Of Life Span Extension. This Study Indicates That Maintenance Of The Fundamental Chromatin Structure Is Critical For Slowing Down The Aging Process And Reveals That Increasing The Histone Supply Extends Life Span.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin regulation and genome maintenance by mammalian SIRT6. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Sir2 Is An Nad(+)-Dependent Histone Deacetylase That Links Chromatin Silencing To Genomic Stability, Cellular Metabolism And Lifespan Regulation. In Mice, Deficiency For The Sir2 Family Member Sirt6 Leads To Genomic Instability, Metabolic Defects And Degenerative Pathologies Associated With Aging. Until Recently, Sirt6 Was An Orphan Enzyme Whose Catalytic Activity And Substrates Were Unclear. However, New Mechanistic Insights Have Come From The Discovery That Sirt6 Is A Highly Substrate-Specific Histone Deacetylase That Promotes Proper Chromatin Function In Several Physiologic Contexts, Including Telomere And Genome Stabilization, Gene Expression And Dna Repair. By Maintaining Both The Integrity And The Expression Of The Mammalian Genome, Sirt6 Thus Serves Several Roles That Parallel Sir2 Function. In This Article, We Review Recent Advances In Understanding The Mechanisms Of Sirt6 Action And Their Implications For Human Biology And Disease.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Regulation of chromatin assembly/disassembly by Rtt109p, a histone H3 Lys56-specific acetyltransferase, in vivo. Rtt109P, A Histone Acetyltransferase, Associates With Active Genes And Acetylates Lysine 56 On Histone H3 In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. However, The Functional Role Of Rtt109P Or H3 Lys(56) Acetylation In Chromatin Assembly/Disassembly (And Hence Gene Expression) Immediately Switching Transcription On Or Off Has Not Been Clearly Elucidated In Vivo. Here, We Show That Rtt109P Promotes The Eviction Of Histone H3 From A Fast Inducible Yeast Gene, Gal1, Following Transcriptional Initiation Via Histone H3 Lys(56) Acetylation. Conversely, The Deposition Of Histone H3 To Gal1 Is Significantly Decreased In The Presence Of Rtt109P Following Transcriptional Termination. Intriguingly, We Also Find That The Deposition Of Histone H2B On Preexisting Non-Acetylated Histone H3 Lys(56) At Gal1 In Δrtt109 Is Significantly Increased Independently Of Histone H3 Deposition Immediately Following Transcriptional Termination Subsequent To A Short Induction. Consistently, Histone H2B Is Not Efficiently Evicted From Gal1 In The Absence Of Rtt109P Immediately Following Transcriptional Induction. Furthermore, We Show That The Stimulated Eviction Or Reduced Deposition Of Histones By Rtt109P Promotes The Association Of Rna Polymerase Ii With Gal1 And Hence The Synthesis Of Gal1 Mrna. These Results, Taken Together, Support The Fact That Rtt109P Regulates The Deposition/Eviction Of Histone H2B In Addition To Its Role In Stimulating Histone H3 Eviction, Thus Providing Insight Into Chromatin Assembly/Disassembly And Hence Gene Expression In Vivo.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Roles for H2A.Z and its acetylation in GAL1 transcription and gene induction, but not GAL1-transcriptional memory. H2A.Z Is A Histone H2A Variant Conserved From Yeast To Humans, And Is Found At 63% Of Promoters In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. This Pattern Of Localization Suggests That H2A.Z Is Somehow Important For Gene Expression Or Regulation. H2A.Z Can Be Acetylated At Up To Four Lysine Residues On Its Amino-Terminal Tail, And Acetylated-H2A.Z Is Enriched In Chromatin Containing Promoters Of Active Genes. We Investigated Whether H2A.Z'S Role In Gal1 Gene Regulation And Gene Expression Depends On H2A.Z Acetylation. Our Findings Suggested That H2A.Z Functioned Both In Gene Regulation And In Gene Expression And That Only Its Role In Gene Regulation Depended Upon Its Acetylation. Our Findings Provided An Alternate Explanation For Results That Were Previously Interpreted As Evidence That H2A.Z Plays A Role In Gal1 Transcriptional Memory. Additionally, Our Findings Provided New Insights Into The Phenotypes Of Htz1Delta Mutants: In The Absence Of H2A.Z, The Swr1 Complex, Which Deposits H2A.Z Into Chromatin, Was Deleterious To The Cell, And Many Of The Phenotypes Of Cells Lacking H2A.Z Were Due To The Swr1 Complex'S Activity Rather Than To The Absence Of H2A.Z Per Se. These Results Highlight The Need To Reevaluate All Studies On The Phenotypes Of Cells Lacking H2A.Z.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Corepressor-directed preacetylation of histone H3 in promoter chromatin primes rapid transcriptional switching of cell-type-specific genes in yeast. Switching Between Alternate States Of Gene Transcription Is Fundamental To A Multitude Of Cellular Regulatory Pathways, Including Those That Govern Differentiation. In Spite Of The Progress In Our Understanding Of Such Transitions In Gene Activity, A Major Unanswered Question Is How Cells Regulate The Timing Of These Switches. Here, We Have Examined The Kinetics Of A Transcriptional Switch That Accompanies The Differentiation Of Yeast Cells Of One Mating Type Into A Distinct New Cell Type. We Found That Cell-Type-Specific Genes Silenced By The Alpha2 Repressor In The Starting State Are Derepressed To Establish The New Mating-Type-Specific Gene Expression Program Coincident With The Loss Of Alpha2 From Promoters. This Rapid Derepression Does Not Require The Preloading Of Rna Polymerase Ii Or A Preinitiation Complex But Instead Depends Upon The Gcn5 Histone Acetyltransferase. Surprisingly, Gcn5-Dependent Acetylation Of Nucleosomes In The Promoters Of Mating-Type-Specific Genes Requires The Corepressor Ssn6-Tup1 Even In The Repressed State. Gcn5 Partially Acetylates The Amino-Terminal Tails Of Histone H3 In Repressed Promoters, Thereby Priming Them For Rapid Derepression Upon Loss Of Alpha2. Thus, Ssn6-Tup1 Not Only Efficiently Represses These Target Promoters But Also Functions To Initiate Derepression By Creating A Chromatin State Poised For Rapid Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Silenced yeast chromatin is maintained by Sir2 in preference to permitting histone acetylations for efficient NER. Very Little Is Currently Known About How Nucleotide Excision Repair (Ner) Functions At The Ends Of Chromosomes. To Examine This, We Introduced The Ura3 Gene Into Either Transcriptionally Active Or Repressed Subtelomeric Regions Of The Yeast Genome. This Enabled Us To Examine The Repair Of Ultraviolet (Uv)-Induced Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimers (Cpds) In Identical Sequences Under Both Circumstances. We Found That Ner Is Significantly More Efficient In The Non-Repressed Subtelomere Than The Repressed One. At The Non-Repressed Subtelomere, Uv Radiation Stimulates Both Histones H3 And H4 Acetylation In A Similar Fashion To That Seen At Other Regions Of The Yeast Genome. These Modifications Occur Regardless Of The Presence Of The Sir2 Histone Deacetylase. On The Other Hand, At The Repressed Subtelomere, Where Repair Is Much Less Efficient, Uv Radiation Is Unable To Stimulate Histone H4 Or H3 Acetylation In The Presence Of Sir2. In The Absence Of Sir2 Both Of These Uv-Induced Modifications Are Detected, Resulting In A Significant Increase In Ner Efficiency In The Region. Our Experiments Reveal That There Are Instances In The Yeast Genome Where The Maintenance Of The Existing Chromatin Structures Dominates Over The Action Of Chromatin Modifications Associated With Efficient Ner.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The histone chaperone Nap1 promotes nucleosome assembly by eliminating nonnucleosomal histone DNA interactions. The Organization Of The Eukaryotic Genome Into Nucleosomes Dramatically Affects The Regulation Of Gene Expression. The Delicate Balance Between Transcription And Dna Compaction Relies Heavily On Nucleosome Dynamics. Surprisingly, Little Is Known About The Free Energy Required To Assemble These Large Macromolecular Complexes And Maintain Them Under Physiological Conditions. Here, We Describe The Thermodynamic Parameters That Drive Nucleosome Formation In Vitro. To Demonstrate The Versatility Of Our Approach, We Test The Effect Of Dna Sequence And H3K56 Acetylation On Nucleosome Thermodynamics. Furthermore, Our Studies Reveal The Mechanism Of Action Of The Histone Chaperone Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1 (Nap1). We Present Evidence For A Paradigm In Which Nucleosome Assembly Requires The Elimination Of Competing, Nonnucleosomal Histone-Dna Interactions By Nap1. This Observation Is Confirmed In Vivo, Wherein Deletion Of The Nap1 Gene In Yeast Results In A Significant Increase In Atypical Histone-Dna Complexes, As Well As In Deregulated Transcription Activation And Repression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	SWR1 complex poises heterochromatin boundaries for antisilencing activity propagation. In Eukaryotes, Chromosomal Processes Are Usually Modulated Through Chromatin-Modifying Complexes That Are Dynamically Targeted To Specific Regions Of Chromatin. In This Study, We Show That The Chromatin-Remodeling Complex Swr1 (Swr1-C) Uses A Distinct Strategy To Regulate Heterochromatin Spreading. Swr1 Binds In A Stable Manner Near Heterochromatin To Prepare Specific Chromosomal Regions For H2A.Z Deposition, Which Can Be Triggered By Nua4-Mediated Acetylation Of Histone H4. We Also Demonstrate Through Experiments With Swc4, A Module Shared By Nua4 And Swr1-C, That The Coupled Actions Of Nua4 And Swr1-C Lead To The Efficient Incorporation Of H2A.Z Into Chromatin And Thereby Synergize Heterochromatin Boundary Activity. Our Results Support A Model Where Swr1-C Resides At The Heterochromatin Boundary To Maintain And Amplify Antisilencing Activity Of Histone H4 Acetylation Through Incorporating H2A.Z Into Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A nucleosome surface formed by histone H4, H2A, and H3 residues is needed for proper histone H3 Lys36 methylation, histone acetylation, and repression of cryptic transcription. Set2-Mediated H3 Lys(36) Methylation Is A Histone Modification That Has Been Demonstrated To Function In Transcriptional Elongation By Recruiting The Rpd3S Histone Deacetylase Complex To Repress Intragenic Cryptic Transcription. Recently, We Identified A Trans-Histone Pathway In Which The Interaction Between The N Terminus Of Set2 And Histone H4 Lys(44) Is Needed To Mediate Trans-Histone H3 Lys(36) Di- And Trimethylation. In The Current Study, We Demonstrate That Mutation Of The Lysine 44 Residue In Histone H4 Or The Set2 Mutant Lacking The Histone H4 Interaction Motif Leads To Intragenic Cryptic Transcripts, Indicating That The Set2 And Histone H4 Interaction Is Important To Repress Intragenic Cryptic Transcription. We Also Determine That Histone H2A Residues (Leu(116) And Leu(117)), Which Are In Close Proximity To Histone H4 Lys(44), Are Needed For Proper Trans-Histone H3 Lys(36) Methylation. Similar To H4 Lys(44) Mutants, Histone H2A Leu(116) And Leu(117) Mutations Exhibited Decreased H3 Lys(36) Di- And Trimethylation, Increased Histone H4 Acetylation, Increased Resistance To 6-Azauracil, And Cryptic Transcription. Interestingly, The Combined Histone H4 Lys(44) And H2A Mutations Have More Severe Methylation Defects And Increased H4 Acetylation Levels. Furthermore, We Identify That Additional Histone H2A And H3 Core Residues Are Also Needed For H3 Lys(36) Di- And Trimethylation. Overall, Our Results Show And Suggest That Multiple H4, H2A, And H3 Residues Contribute To And Form A Set2 Docking/Recognition Site On The Nucleosomal Surface So That Proper Set2-Mediated H3 Lys(36) Di- And Trimethylation, Histone Acetylation, And Transcriptional Elongation Can Occur.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Asf1 can promote trimethylation of H3 K36 by Set2. Asf1 Is A Conserved Histone H3/H4 Chaperone That Can Assemble And Disassemble Nucleosomes And Promote Histone Acetylation. Set2 Is An H3 K36 Methyltransferase. The Functions Of These Proteins Intersect In The Context Of Transcription Elongation By Rna Polymerase Ii: Both Contribute To The Establishment Of Repressive Chromatin Structures That Inhibit Spurious Intragenic Transcription. Here We Characterize Further Interactions Between Budding Yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) Asf1 And Set2 Using Assays Of Intragenic Transcription, H3/H4 Posttranslational Modification, Coding Region Cross-Linking Of Asf1 And Set2, And Cooccurrence Of Asf1 And Set2 In Protein Complexes. We Find That At Some Genes Asf1 And Set2 Control Chromatin Metabolism As Components Of Separate Pathways. However, The Existence Of A Low-Abundance Complex Containing Both Proteins Suggests That Asf1 And Set2 Can More Directly Collaborate In Chromatin Regulation. Consistent With This Possibility, We Show That Asf1 Stimulates Set2 Occupancy Of The Coding Region Of A Highly Transcribed Gene By A Mechanism That Depends On Asf1 Binding To H3/H4. This Function Of Asf1 Promotes The Switch From Di- To Trimethylation Of H3 K36 At That Gene. These Results Support The View That Set2 Function In Chromatin Metabolism Can Intimately Involve Histone Chaperone Asf1.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Gene-wide histone acetylation at the yeast INO1 requires the transcriptional activator Ino2p. The Relationship Between Histone Acetylation And Transcriptional Activation At The Yeast Ino1 Gene Was Addressed. Ino1 Encodes A Key Enzyme Required For The De Novo Synthesis Of Phosphatidylinositol. Induction Of Ino1 Resulted In Acetylation Of Both Histones H3 And H4 At The Ino1 Promoter And Sequences Farther Downstream In The Coding Region, Suggesting A Gene-Wide Acetylation In Response To Transcriptional Activation. Such Chromatin Remodeling Activity Requires The Presence Of Transcriptional Activator Ino2P. This Indicates That Histone Acetylation Is An Activator-Dependent Event. Furthermore, The Increase Of Histone Acetylation Is Due To The Increase Of Acetylation Levels Per Nucleosome Rather Than The Increase Of Nucleosome Density. Therefore, These Observations Constitute Evidence For The Molecular Mechanism Of The Correlation Between Histone Acetylation And Ino1 Activity.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Insights into distinct regulatory modes of nucleosome positioning. The Nucleosome Is The Fundamental Unit Of Eukaryotic Genomes. Experimental Evidence Suggests That The Genomic Dna Sequence And A Variety Of Protein Factors Contribute To Nucleosome Positioning In Vivo. However, How Nucleosome Positioning Is Determined Locally Is Still Largely Unknown.We Found That Transcription Factor Binding Sites (Tfbss) With Particular Nucleosomal Contexts Show A Preference To Reside On Specific Chromosomes. We Identified Four Typical Gene Classes Associated With Distinct Regulatory Modes Of Nucleosome Positioning, And Further Showed That They Are Distinguished By Transcriptional Regulation Patterns. The First Mode Involves The Cooperativity Between Chromatin Remodeling And Stable Transcription Factor (Tf)-Dna Binding That Is Linked To High Intrinsic Dna Binding Affinities, Evicting Nucleosomes From Favorable Dna Sequences. The Second Is The Dna-Encoded Low Nucleosome Occupancy That Is Associated With High Gene Activity. The Third Is Through Chromatin Remodeling And Histone Acetylation, Sliding Nucleosomes Along Dna. This Mode Is Linked To More Cryptic Sites For Tf Binding. The Last Consists Of The Nucleosome-Enriched Organization Driven By Other Factors That Overrides Nucleosome Sequence Preferences. In Addition, We Showed That High Polymerase Ii (Pol Ii) Occupancy Is Associated With High Nucleosome Occupancy Around The Transcription Start Site (Tss).We Identified Four Different Regulatory Modes Of Nucleosome Positioning And Gave Insights Into Mechanisms That Specify Promoter Nucleosome Location. We Suggest Two Distinct Modes Of Recruitment Of Pol Ii, Which Are Selectively Employed By Different Genes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H3K4 and K36 methylation, Chd1 and Rpd3S oppose the functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4-Spt5 in transcription. Spt4-Spt5, A General Transcription Elongation Factor For Rna Polymerase Ii, Also Has Roles In Chromatin Regulation. However, The Relationships Between These Functions Are Not Clear. Previously, We Isolated Suppressors Of A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Spt5 Mutation In Genes Encoding Members Of The Paf1 Complex, Which Regulates Several Cotranscriptional Histone Modifications, And Chd1, A Chromatin Remodeling Enzyme. Here, We Show That This Suppression Of Spt5 Can Result From Loss Of Histone H3 Lysines 4 Or 36 Methylation, Or Reduced Recruitment Of Chd1 Or The Rpd3S Complex. These Spt5 Suppressors Also Rescue The Synthetic Growth Defects Observed In Spt5 Mutants That Also Lack Elongation Factor Tfiis. Using A Flo8 Reporter Gene, We Found That A Chd1 Mutation Caused Cryptic Initiation Of Transcription. We Further Observed Enhancement Of Cryptic Initiation In Chd1 Isw1 Mutants And Increased Histone Acetylation In A Chd1 Mutant. We Suggest That, As Previously Proposed For H3 Lysine 36 Methylation And The Rpd3S Complex, H3 Lysine 4 Methylation And Chd1 Function To Maintain Normal Chromatin Structures Over Transcribed Genes, And That One Function Of Spt4-Spt5 Is To Help Rna Polymerase Ii Overcome The Repressive Effects Of These Histone Modifications And Chromatin Regulators On Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	[Identification and application of yeast histone acetyltransferases Elp3 polyclonal antibody]. Yeast Elongation Protein 3 (Yelp3), The Catalytic Subunit Of The Multi-Subunit Histone Acetyltransferase Elongator Complex, Is Involved In Histone Acetylation And Transcription, Exocytosis And Trna Modification. To Study The Complex Function Of Yelp3 In Yeast, We Amplified The Yelp3 Gene Fragment Encoding 73Aa In The N-Terminal From Plasmid Pyes2-Yelp3, And Then Cloned It Into Pmxb10 To Construct The Recombinant Plasmid Pmxb10-Yelp3-219. We Expressed The Fusion Protein In E. Coli Bl21 (De3), Then Purified It By Chin Affinity Column, And Finally Obtained The Soluble Purified Protein (8.0 Kd), Which Was Used To Immune The Rabbits For Acquiring Antiserum. Elisa And Western Blotting Indicated That The Polyclonal Antibody Was Of High Titration And Specificity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (Chip) Assay With This Antibody Suggested That Yhelp3 Exerted The Transcriptional Regulatory Function Directly Through Its Presence On The Ssa3 Gene; This Might Be The Reason That It Can Rescue The Delay Activation Of Ssa3 In Elp3Delta Cells.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A negatively charged residue in place of histone H3K56 supports chromatin assembly factor association but not genotoxic stress resistance. In Fungal Species, Lysine 56 Of Newly Synthesized Histone H3 Molecules Is Modified By The Acetyltransferase Rtt109, Which Promotes Resistance To Genotoxic Agents. To Further Explore How H3 K56Ac Contributes To Genome Stability, We Conducted Screens For Suppressors Of The Dna Damage Sensitivity Of Budding Yeast Rtt109 Delta Mutants. We Recovered A Single Extragenic Suppressor Mutation That Efficiently Restored Damage Resistance. The Suppressor Is A Point Mutation In The Histone H3 Gene Hht2, And Converts Lysine 56 To Glutamic Acid. In Some Ways, K56E Mimics K56Ac, Because It Suppresses Other Mutations That Interfere With The Production Of H3 K56Ac And Restores Histone Binding To Chromatin Assembly Proteins Caf-1 And Rtt106. Therefore, We Demonstrate That Enhanced Association With Chromatin Assembly Factors Can Be Accomplished Not Only By Acetylation-Mediated Charge Neutralization Of H3K56 But Also By The Replacement Of The Positively Charged Lysine With An Acidic Residue. These Data Suggest That Removal Of The Positive Charge On Lysine 56 Is The Functionally Important Consequence Of H3K56 Acetylation. Additionally, The Suppressive Function Of K56E Requires The Presence Of A Second H3 Allele, Because K56E Impairs Growth When It Is The Sole Source Of Histones, Even More So Than Does Constitutive H3K56 Acetylation. Our Studies Therefore Emphasize How H3 K56Ac Not Only Promotes Chromatin Assembly But Also Leads To Chromosomal Malfunction If Not Removed Following Histone Deposition.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Reconstitution of heterochromatin-dependent transcriptional gene silencing. Heterochromatin Assembly In Budding Yeast Requires The Sir Complex, Which Contains The Nad-Dependent Deacetylase Sir2 And The Sir3 And Sir4 Proteins. Sir3 Binds To Nucleosomes Containing Deacetylated Histone H4 Lysine 16 (H4K16) And, With Sir4, Promotes Spreading Of Sir2 And Deacetylation Along The Chromatin Fiber. Combined Action Of Histone Modifying And Binding Activities Is A Conserved Hallmark Of Heterochromatin, But The Relative Contribution Of Each Activity To Silencing Has Remained Unclear. Here, We Reconstitute Sir-Chromatin Complexes Using Purified Components And Show That The Sir Complex Efficiently Deacetylates Chromatin Templates And Promotes The Assembly Of Altered Structures That Silence Gal4-Vp16-Activated Transcription. Silencing Requires All Three Sir Proteins, Even With Fully Deacetylated Chromatin, And Involves The Specific Association Of Sir3 With Deacetylated H4K16. These Results Define A Minimal Set Of Components That Mediate Heterochromatic Gene Silencing And Demonstrate Distinct Contributions For Histone Deacetylation And Nucleosome Binding In The Silencing Mechanism.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Multiple histone modifications in euchromatin promote heterochromatin formation by redundant mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Methylation Of Lysine 79 On Histone H3 By Dot1 Is Required For Maintenance Of Heterochromatin Structure In Yeast And Humans. However, This Histone Modification Occurs Predominantly In Euchromatin. Thus, Dot1 Affects Silencing By Indirect Mechanisms And Does Not Act By The Recruitment Model Commonly Proposed For Histone Modifications. To Better Understand The Role Of H3K79 Methylation Gene Silencing, We Investigated The Silencing Function Of Dot1 By Genetic Suppressor And Enhancer Analysis And Examined The Relationship Between Dot1 And Other Global Euchromatic Histone Modifiers.We Determined That Loss Of H3K79 Methylation Results In A Partial Silencing Defect That Could Be Bypassed By Conditions That Promote Targeting Of Sir Proteins To Heterochromatin. Furthermore, The Silencing Defect In Strains Lacking Dot1 Was Dependent On Methylation Of H3K4 By Set1 And Histone Acetylation By Gcn5, Elp3, And Sas2 In Euchromatin. Our Study Shows That Multiple Histone Modifications Associated With Euchromatin Positively Modulate The Function Of Heterochromatin By Distinct Mechanisms. Genetic Interactions Between Set1 And Set2 Suggested That The H3K36 Methyltransferase Set2, Unlike Most Other Euchromatic Modifiers, Negatively Affects Gene Silencing.Our Genetic Dissection Of Dot1'S Role In Silencing In Budding Yeast Showed That Heterochromatin Formation Is Modulated By Multiple Euchromatic Histone Modifiers That Act By Non-Overlapping Mechanisms. We Discuss How Euchromatic Histone Modifiers Can Make Negative As Well As Positive Contributions To Gene Silencing By Competing With Heterochromatin Proteins Within Heterochromatin, Within Euchromatin, And At The Boundary Between Euchromatin And Heterochromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H3 lysine 4 di-methylation: a novel mark for transcriptional fidelity?. Although Histone H3 Lysine 4 Methylation (H3K4Me) Is Strongly Associated With Active Transcription, An Increasing Number Of Arguments Indicate Its Repressive Role In Gene Expression. Recent Data In The Mammalian And Budding Yeast Systems Have Provided Evidence For H3K4Me2 And H3K4Me3 Tethering Histone Deacetylase Complexes (Hdacs) To Modulate Gene Expression. In S. Cerevisiae, This Regulation Is Mediated By Specific Subunits Within Hdacs That Recognize The Methylation Status Of H3K4 Allowing Chromatin Reorganization To Attenuate Or Repress Transcription. Albeit We Are Still A Long Way From Understanding The Mechanism And Biological Consequences, It Is Becoming Clear That H3K4Me At Certain Chromatin Loci May Prevent Aberrant Gene Expression Or Modulate Transcriptional Response. This Review Will Provide A Brief Overview Of A Novel Interpretation Of H3K4Me And Its Outcome On Transcription Regulation And Will Suggest Future Challenges For The Field Of Epigenetics.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Collaboration between the essential Esa1 acetyltransferase and the Rpd3 deacetylase is mediated by H4K12 histone acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Histone Modifications That Regulate Chromatin-Dependent Processes Are Catalyzed By Multisubunit Complexes. These Can Function In Both Targeting Activities To Specific Genes And In Regulating Genomewide Levels Of Modifications. In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Esa1 And Rpd3 Have Opposing Enzymatic Activities And Are Catalytic Subunits Of Multiple Chromatin Modifying Complexes With Key Roles In Processes Such As Transcriptional Regulation And Dna Repair. Esa1 Is An Essential Histone Acetyltransferase That Belongs To The Highly Conserved Myst Family. This Study Presents Evidence That The Yeast Histone Deacetylase Gene, Rpd3, When Deleted, Suppressed Esa1 Conditional Mutant Phenotypes. Deletion Of Rpd3 Reversed Rdna And Telomeric Silencing Defects And Restored Global H4 Acetylation Levels, In Addition To Rescuing The Growth Defect Of A Temperature-Sensitive Esa1 Mutant. This Functional Genetic Interaction Between Esa1 And Rpd3 Was Mediated Through The Rpd3L Complex. The Suppression Of Esa1'S Growth Defect By Disruption Of Rpd3L Was Dependent On Lysine 12 Of Histone H4. We Propose A Model Whereby Esa1 And Rpd3L Act Coordinately To Control The Acetylation Of H4 Lysine 12 To Regulate Transcription, Thereby Emphasizing The Importance Of Dynamic Acetylation And Deacetylation Of This Particular Histone Residue In Maintaining Cell Viability.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation regulates cellular lifespan. Cells Undergoing Developmental Processes Are Characterized By Persistent Non-Genetic Alterations In Chromatin, Termed Epigenetic Changes, Represented By Distinct Patterns Of Dna Methylation And Histone Post-Translational Modifications. Sirtuins, A Group Of Conserved Nad(+)-Dependent Deacetylases Or Adp-Ribosyltransferases, Promote Longevity In Diverse Organisms; However, Their Molecular Mechanisms In Ageing Regulation Remain Poorly Understood. Yeast Sir2, The First Member Of The Family To Be Found, Establishes And Maintains Chromatin Silencing By Removing Histone H4 Lysine 16 Acetylation And Bringing In Other Silencing Proteins. Here We Report An Age-Associated Decrease In Sir2 Protein Abundance Accompanied By An Increase In H4 Lysine 16 Acetylation And Loss Of Histones At Specific Subtelomeric Regions In Replicatively Old Yeast Cells, Which Results In Compromised Transcriptional Silencing At These Loci. Antagonizing Activities Of Sir2 And Sas2, A Histone Acetyltransferase, Regulate The Replicative Lifespan Through Histone H4 Lysine 16 At Subtelomeric Regions. This Pathway, Distinct From Existing Ageing Models For Yeast, May Represent An Evolutionarily Conserved Function Of Sirtuins In Regulation Of Replicative Ageing By Maintenance Of Intact Telomeric Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	An rtt109-independent role for vps75 in transcription-associated nucleosome dynamics. The Histone Chaperone Vps75 Forms A Complex With, And Stimulates The Activity Of, The Histone Acetyltransferase Rtt109. However, Vps75 Can Also Be Isolated On Its Own And Might Therefore Possess Rtt109-Independent Functions. Analysis Of Epistatic Miniarray Profiles Showed That Vps75 Genetically Interacts With Factors Involved In Transcription Regulation Whereas Rtt109 Clusters With Genes Linked To Dna Replication/Repair. Additional Genetic And Biochemical Experiments Revealed A Close Relationship Between Vps75 And Rna Polymerase Ii. Furthermore, Vps75 Is Recruited To Activated Genes In An Rtt109-Independent Manner, And Its Genome-Wide Association With Genes Correlates With Transcription Rate. Expression Microarray Analysis Identified A Number Of Genes Whose Normal Expression Depends On Vps75. Interestingly, Histone H2B Dynamics At Some Of These Genes Are Consistent With A Role For Vps75 In Histone H2A/H2B Eviction/Deposition During Transcription. Indeed, Reconstitution Of Nucleosome Disassembly Using The Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodeler Rsc And Vps75 Revealed That These Proteins Can Cooperate To Remove H2A/H2B Dimers From Nucleosomes. These Results Indicate A Role For Vps75 In Nucleosome Dynamics During Transcription, And Importantly, This Function Appears To Be Largely Independent Of Rtt109.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide replication profiles indicate an expansive role for Rpd3L in regulating replication initiation timing or efficiency, and reveal genomic loci of Rpd3 function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Higher Eukaryotes, Heritable Gene Silencing Is Associated With Histone Deacetylation And Late Replication Timing. In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, The Histone Deacetylase Rpd3 Regulates Gene Expression And Also Modulates Replication Timing; However, These Mechanisms Have Been Suggested To Be Independent, And No Global Association Has Been Found Between Replication Timing And Gene Expression Levels. Using 5-Bromo-2'-Deoxyuridine (Brdu) Incorporation To Generate Genome-Wide Replication Profiles, We Identified >100 Late-Firing Replication Origins That Are Regulated By Rpd3L, Which Is Specifically Targeted To Promoters To Silence Transcription. Rpd3S, Which Recompacts Chromatin After Transcription, Plays A Primary Role At Only A Handful Of Origins, But Subtly Influences Initiation Timing Globally. The Ability Of These Functionally Distinct Rpd3 Complexes To Affect Replication Initiation Timing Supports The Idea That Histone Deacetylation Directly Influences Initiation Timing. Accordingly, Loss Of Rpd3 Function Results In Higher Levels Of Histone H3 And H4 Acetylation Surrounding Rpd3-Regulated Origins, And These Origins Show A Significant Association With Rpd3 Chromatin Binding And Gene Regulation, Supporting A General Link Between Histone Acetylation, Replication Timing, And Control Of Gene Expression In Budding Yeast. Our Results Also Reveal A Novel And Complementary Genomic Map Of Rpd3L- And Rpd3S-Regulated Chromosomal Loci.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Mutational analysis of the Sir3 BAH domain reveals multiple points of interaction with nucleosomes. Sir3, A Component Of The Transcriptional Silencing Complex In The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Has An N-Terminal Bah Domain That Is Crucial For The Protein'S Silencing Function. Previous Work Has Shown That The N-Terminal Alanine Residue Of Sir3 (Ala2) And Its Acetylation Play An Important Role In Silencing. Here We Show That The Silencing Defects Of Sir3 Ala2 Mutants Can Be Suppressed By Mutations In Histones H3 And H4, Specifically, By H3 D77N And H4 H75Y Mutations. Additionally, A Mutational Analysis Demonstrates That Three Separate Regions Of The Sir3 Bah Domain Are Important For Its Role In Silencing. Many Of These Bah Mutations Also Can Be Suppressed By The H3 D77N And H4 H75Y Mutations. In Agreement With The Results Of Others, In Vitro Experiments Show That The Sir3 Bah Domain Can Interact With Partially Purified Nucleosomes. The Silencing-Defective Bah Mutants Are Defective For This Interaction. These Results, Together With The Previously Characterized Interaction Between The C-Terminal Region Of Sir3 And The Histone H3/H4 Tails, Suggest That Sir3 Utilizes Multiple Domains To Interact With Nucleosomes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Untargeted tail acetylation of histones in chromatin: lessons from yeast. Dynamic Acetylation Of Lysine Residues In The Amino-Terminal Tails Of The Core Histones Is Functionally Important For The Regulation Of Diverse Dna-Dependent Processes In The Nucleus, Including Replication, Transcription, And Dna Repair. The Targeted And Untargeted Activities Of Histone Lysine Acetylases (Kats) And Deacetylases (Hdacs) Both Contribute To The Dynamics Of Chromatin Acetylation. While The Mechanisms And Functional Consequences Of Targeted On Histone Acetylation Are Well Understood, Relatively Little Is Known About Untargeted Histone Acetylation. Here, We Review The Current Understanding Of The Mechanisms By Which Untargeted Kat And Hdac Activities Modulate The Acetylation State Of Nucleosomal Histones, Focusing On Results Obtained For H3 And H4 In Budding Yeast. We Also Highlight Unresolved Problems In This Area, Including The Question Of How A Particular Steady-State Level Of Untargeted Acetylation Is Set In The Absence Of Cis-Dependent Mechanisms That Instruct The Activity Of Kats And Hdacs.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Control of replication initiation by the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 histone deacetylase. Replication Initiation At Origins Of Replication In The Yeast Genome Takes Place On Chromatin As A Template, Raising The Question How Histone Modifications, For Instance Histone Acetylation, Influence Origin Firing. Initiation Requires Binding Of The Replication Initiator, The Origin Recognition Complex (Orc), To A Consensus Sequence Within Origins. In Addition, Other Proteins Bind To Recognition Sites In The Vicinity Of Orc And Support Initiation. In Previous Work, We Identified Sum1 As An Origin-Binding Protein That Contributes To Efficient Replication Initiation. Sum1 Is Part Of The Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 Complex That Represses Meiotic Genes During Vegetative Growth Via Histone Deacetylation By The Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Hst1.In This Study, We Investigated How Sum1 Affected Replication Initiation. We Found That It Functioned In Initiation As A Component Of The Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 Complex, Implying A Role For Histone Deacetylation In Origin Activity. We Identified Several Origins In The Yeast Genome Whose Activity Depended On Both Sum1 And Hst1. Importantly, Sum1Delta Or Hst1Delta Caused A Significant Increase In Histone H4 Lysine 5 (H4 K5) Acetylation Levels, But Not Other H4 Acetylation Sites, At Those Origins. Furthermore, Mutation Of Lysines To Glutamines In The H4 Tail, Which Imitates The Constantly Acetylated State, Resulted In A Reduction Of Origin Activity Comparable To That In The Absence Of Hst1, Showing That Deacetylation Of H4 Was Important For Full Initiation Capacity Of These Origins.Taken Together, Our Results Demonstrate A Role For Histone Deacetylation In Origin Activity And Reveal A Novel Aspect Of Origin Regulation By Chromatin. These Results Suggest Recruitment Of The Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 Complex To A Number Of Yeast Origins, Where Hst1 Deacetylated H4 K5.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H3 K36 methylation is mediated by a trans-histone methylation pathway involving an interaction between Set2 and histone H4. Set2-Mediated H3 K36 Methylation Is An Important Histone Modification On Chromatin During Transcription Elongation. Although Set2 Associates With The Phosphorylated C-Terminal Domain (Ctd) Of Rna Polymerase Ii (Rnapii), The Mechanism Of Set2 Binding To Chromatin And Subsequent Exertion Of Its Methyltransferase Activity Is Relatively Uncharacterized. We Identified A Critical Lysine Residue In Histone H4 That Is Needed For Interaction With Set2 And Proper H3 K36 Di- And Trimethylation. We Also Determined That The N Terminus Of Set2 Contains A Histone H4 Interaction Motif That Allows Set2 To Bind Histone H4 And Nucleosomes. A Set2 Mutant Lacking The Histone H4 Interaction Motif Is Able To Bind To The Phosphorylated Ctd Of Rnapii And Associate With Gene-Specific Loci But Is Defective For H3 K36 Di- And Trimethylation. In Addition, This Set2 Mutant Shows Increased H4 Acetylation And Resistance To 6-Azauracil. Overall, Our Study Defines A New Interaction Between Set2 And Histone H4 That Mediates Trans-Histone Regulation Of H3 K36 Methylation, Which Is Needed For The Preventative Maintenance And Integrity Of The Genome.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Structure of Vps75 and implications for histone chaperone function. The Vacuolar Protein Sorting 75 (Vps75) Histone Chaperone Participates In Chromatin Assembly And Disassembly At Both Active And Inactive Genes Through The Preferential Binding To Histone H3-H4. Vps75 Is Also One Of Two Histone Chaperones, Along With Antisilencing Factor 1, That Promotes Histone H3-Lys-56 Acetylation By The Regulation Of Ty1 Transposition Protein 109 (Rtt109) Histone Acetyltransferase. Here, We Report The X-Ray Crystal Structure Of Vps75 And Carry Out Biochemical Studies To Characterize Its Interaction With Rtt109. We Find That The Vps75 Structure Forms A Homodimeric "Headphone" Architecture That Includes An Extended Helical Dimerization Domain And Earmuff Domains At Opposite Ends And Sides Of The Dimerization Domain. Despite The Similar Overall Architecture With The Yeast Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1 And Human Set/Taf-1Beta/Inhat Histone Chaperones, Vps75 Shows Several Unique Features Including The Relative Disposition Of The Earmuff Domains To The Dimerization Domain, Characteristics Of The Earmuff Domains, And A Pronounced Cleft At The Center Of The Vps75 Dimer. These Differences Appear To Correlate With The Unique Function Of Vps75 To Interact With Rtt109 For Histone Acetylation. Our Biochemical Studies Reveal That Two Surfaces On The Earmuff Domain Of Vps75 Participate In Rtt109 Interaction With A Stoichiometry Of 2:1, Thus Leaving The Pronounced Central Cleft Of The Vps75 Dimer Largely Accessible For Histone Binding. Taken Together, Our Data Provide A Structural Framework For Understanding How Vps75 Mediates Both Nucleosome Assembly And Histone Acetylation By Rtt109.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genomewide screen for negative regulators of sirtuin activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals 40 loci and links to metabolism. Sirtuins Are Conserved Proteins Implicated In Myriad Key Processes Including Gene Control, Aging, Cell Survival, Metabolism, And Dna Repair. In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, The Sirtuin Silent Information Regulator 2 (Sir2) Promotes Silent Chromatin Formation, Suppresses Recombination Between Repeats, And Inhibits Senescence. We Performed A Genomewide Screen For Factors That Negatively Regulate Sir Activity At A Reporter Gene Placed Immediately Outside A Silenced Region. After Linkage Analysis, Assessment Of Sir Dependency, And Knockout Tag Verification, 40 Loci Were Identified, Including 20 That Have Not Been Previously Described To Regulate Sir. In Addition To Chromatin-Associated Factors Known To Prevent Ectopic Silencing (Bdf1, Sas-I Complex, Rpd3L Complex, Ku), We Identified The Rtt109 Dna Repair-Associated Histone H3 Lysine 56 Acetyltransferase As An Anti-Silencing Factor. Our Findings Indicate That Rtt109 Functions Independently Of Its Proposed Effectors, The Rtt101 Cullin, Mms1, And Mms22, And Demonstrate Unexpected Interplay Between H3K56 And H4K16 Acetylation. The Screen Also Identified Subunits Of Mediator (Soh1, Srb2, And Srb5) And Mrna Metabolism Factors (Kem1, Ssd1), Thus Raising The Possibility That Weak Silencing Affects Some Aspect Of Mrna Structure. Finally, Several Factors Connected To Metabolism Were Identified. These Include The Pas-Domain Metabolic Sensor Kinase Psk2, The Mitochondrial Homocysteine Detoxification Enzyme Lap3, And The Fe-S Cluster Protein Maturase Isa2. We Speculate That Pas Kinase May Integrate Metabolic Signals To Control Sirtuin Activity.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Efg1-mediated recruitment of NuA4 to promoters is required for hypha-specific Swi/Snf binding and activation in Candida albicans. Efg1 Is Essential For Hyphal Development And Virulence In The Human Pathogenic Fungus Candida Albicans. How Efg1 Regulates Gene Expression Is Unknown. Here, We Show That Efg1 Interacts With Components Of The Nucleosome Acetyltransferase Of H4 (Nua4) Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Complex In Both Yeast And Hyphal Cells. Deleting Yng2, A Subunit Of The Nua4 Hat Module, Results In A Significant Decrease In The Acetylation Level Of Nucleosomal H4 And A Profound Defect In Hyphal Development, As Well As A Defect In The Expression Of Hypha-Specific Genes. Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, Efg1 And The Nua4 Complex Are Found At The Uas Regions Of Hypha-Specific Genes In Both Yeast And Hyphal Cells, And Efg1 Is Required For The Recruitment Of Nua4. Nucleosomal H4 Acetylation At The Promoters Peaks During Initial Hyphal Induction In An Efg1-Dependent Manner. We Also Find That Efg1 Bound To The Promoters Of Hypha-Specific Genes Is Critical For Recruitment Of The Swi/Snf Chromatin Remodeling Complex During Hyphal Induction. Our Data Show That The Recruitment Of The Nua4 Complex By Efg1 To The Promoters Of Hypha-Specific Genes Is Required For Nucleosomal H4 Acetylation At The Promoters During Hyphal Induction And For Subsequent Binding Of Swi/Snf And Transcriptional Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylation in the globular core of histone H3 on lysine-56 promotes chromatin disassembly during transcriptional activation. Promoter Chromatin Disassembly Is A Widely Used Mechanism To Regulate Eukaryotic Transcriptional Induction. Delaying Histone H3/H4 Removal From The Yeast Pho5 Promoter Also Leads To Delayed Removal Of Histones H2A/H2B, Suggesting A Constant Equilibrium Of Assembly And Disassembly Of H2A/H2B, Whereas H3/H4 Disassembly Is The Highly Regulated Step. Toward Understanding How H3/H4 Disassembly Is Regulated, We Observe A Drastic Increase In The Levels Of Histone H3 Acetylated On Lysine-56 (K56Ac) During Promoter Chromatin Disassembly. Indeed, Promoter Chromatin Disassembly Is Driven By Rtt109 And Asf1-Dependent Acetylation Of H3 K56. Conversely, Promoter Chromatin Reassembly During Transcriptional Repression Is Accompanied By Decreased Levels Of Histone H3 Acetylated On Lysine-56, And A Mutation That Prevents K56 Acetylation Increases The Rate Of Transcriptional Repression. As Such, H3 K56 Acetylation Drives Chromatin Toward The Disassembled State During Transcriptional Activation, Whereas Loss Of H3 K56 Acetylation Drives The Chromatin Toward The Assembled State.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Roles for Ctk1 and Spt6 in regulating the different methylation states of histone H3 lysine 36. Set2 (Kmt3)-Dependent Methylation (Me) Of Histone H3 At Lysine 36 (H3K36) Promotes Deacetylation Of Transcribed Chromatin And Represses Cryptic Promoters Within Genes. Although Set2 Is The Only Methyltransferase (Kmtase) For H3K36 In Yeast, It Is Not Known If Set2 Is Regulated Or Whether The Different Methylation States At H3K36 Are Functionally Distinct. Here We Show That The N-Terminal 261 Residues Of Set2 (Set2(1-261)), Containing The Set Kmtase Domain, Are Sufficient For H3K36Me2, Histone Deacetylation, And Repression Of Cryptic Promoters At Ste11. Set2-Catalyzed H3K36Me2 Does Not Require Either Ctk1-Dependent Phosphorylation Of Rna Polymerase Ii (Rnapii) Or The Presence Of The Phospho-C-Terminal Domain (Ctd) Interaction (Sri) Domain Of Set2. This Finding Is Consistent With A Known Correlation Between H3K36Me2 And Whether A Gene Is On Or Off, But Not The Level Of Activity Of A Gene. By Contrast, H3K36Me3 Requires Spt6, Proline 38 On Histone H3 (H3P38), The Ctd Of Rnapii, Ctk1, And The C-Terminal Sri Domain Of Set2. We Suggest That The C-Terminal Region Of Set2, In Conjunction With The Phosphorylated Ctd Of Rnapii, Influences The Kmtase Activity To Promote H3K36Me3 During Transcription Elongation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Missing value imputation for microarray gene expression data using histone acetylation information. It Is An Important Pre-Processing Step To Accurately Estimate Missing Values In Microarray Data, Because Complete Datasets Are Required In Numerous Expression Profile Analysis In Bioinformatics. Although Several Methods Have Been Suggested, Their Performances Are Not Satisfactory For Datasets With High Missing Percentages.The Paper Explores The Feasibility Of Doing Missing Value Imputation With The Help Of Gene Regulatory Mechanism. An Imputation Framework Called Histone Acetylation Information Aided Imputation Method (Haiimpute Method) Is Presented. It Incorporates The Histone Acetylation Information Into The Conventional Knn(K-Nearest Neighbor) And Lls(Local Least Square) Imputation Algorithms For Final Prediction Of The Missing Values. The Experimental Results Indicated That The Use Of Acetylation Information Can Provide Significant Improvements In Microarray Imputation Accuracy. The Haiimpute Methods Consistently Improve The Widely Used Methods Such As Knn And Lls In Terms Of Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (Nrmse). Meanwhile, The Genes Imputed By Haiimpute Methods Are More Correlated With The Original Complete Genes In Terms Of Pearson Correlation Coefficients. Furthermore, The Proposed Methods Also Outperform Goimpute, Which Is One Of The Existing Related Methods That Use The Functional Similarity As The External Information.We Demonstrated That The Using Of Histone Acetylation Information Could Greatly Improve The Performance Of The Imputation Especially At High Missing Percentages. This Idea Can Be Generalized To Various Imputation Methods To Facilitate The Performance. Moreover, With More Knowledge Accumulated On Gene Regulatory Mechanism In Addition To Histone Acetylation, The Performance Of Our Approach Can Be Further Improved And Verified.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Molecular implementation and physiological roles for histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation. Chromosomal Surfaces Are Ornamented With A Variety Of Post-Translational Modifications Of Histones, Which Are Required For The Regulation Of Many Of The Dna-Templated Processes. Such Histone Modifications Include Acetylation, Sumoylation, Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, And Methylation. Histone Modifications Can Either Function By Disrupting Chromosomal Contacts Or By Regulating Non-Histone Protein Interactions With Chromatin. In This Review, Recent Findings Will Be Discussed Regarding The Regulation Of The Implementation And Physiological Significance For One Such Histone Modification, Histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) Methylation By The Yeast Compass And Mammalian Compass-Like Complexes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Synthetic lethal screens identify gene silencing processes in yeast and implicate the acetylated amino terminus of Sir3 in recognition of the nucleosome core. Dot1 Methylates Histone H3 Lysine 79 (H3K79) On The Nucleosome Core And Is Involved In Sir Protein-Mediated Silencing. Previous Studies Suggested That H3K79 Methylation Within Euchromatin Prevents Nonspecific Binding Of The Sir Proteins, Which In Turn Facilitates Binding Of The Sir Proteins In Unmethylated Silent Chromatin. However, The Mechanism By Which The Sir Protein Binding Is Influenced By This Modification Is Unclear. We Performed Genome-Wide Synthetic Genetic Array (Sga) Analysis And Identified Interactions Of Dot1 With Sir1 And Pol32. The Synthetic Growth Defects Found By Sga Analysis Were Attributed To The Loss Of Mating Type Identity Caused By A Synthetic Silencing Defect. By Using Epistasis Analysis, Dot1, Sir1, And Pol32 Could Be Placed In Different Pathways Of Silencing. Dot1 Shared Its Silencing Phenotypes With The Nata N-Terminal Acetyltransferase Complex And The Conserved N-Terminal Bromo Adjacent Homology (Bah) Domain Of Sir3 (A Substrate Of Nata). We Classified All Of These As Affecting A Common Silencing Process, And We Show That Mutations In This Process Lead To Nonspecific Binding Of Sir3 To Chromatin. Our Results Suggest That The Bah Domain Of Sir3 Binds To Histone H3K79 And That Acetylation Of The Bah Domain Is Required For The Binding Specificity Of Sir3 For Nucleosomes Unmethylated At H3K79.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Global histone acetylation induces functional genomic reorganization at mammalian nuclear pore complexes. The Nuclear Localization Of Genes Is Intimately Tied To Their Transcriptional Status In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, With Populations Of Both Active And Silent Genes Interacting With Components Of The Nuclear Envelope. We Investigated The Relationship Between The Mammalian Nuclear Pore And The Human Genome By Generating High-Resolution, Chromosome-Wide Binding Maps Of Human Nucleoporin 93 (Nup93) In The Presence And Absence Of A Potent Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (Hdaci). Here, We Report Extensive Genomic Reorganization With Respect To The Nuclear Pore Following Hdaci Treatment, Including The Recruitment Of Promoter Regions, Euchromatin-Rich Domains, And Differentially Expressed Genes. In Addition To Biochemical Mapping, We Visually Demonstrate The Physical Relocalization Of Several Genomic Loci With Respect To The Nuclear Periphery. Our Studies Show That Inhibiting Hdacs Leads To Significant Changes In Genomic Organization, Recruiting Regions Of Transcriptional Regulation To Mammalian Nuclear Pore Complexes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Global transcription regulation by DNA topoisomerase I in exponentially growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells: activation of telomere-proximal genes by TOP1 deletion. To Establish The Cellular Functions Of Dna Topoisomerase I-B (Top1P) At A Global Level, We Have Determined The Expression Profiles And Histone Modification Patterns Affected By Top1 Gene Deletion (Deltatop1) In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. In Exponentially Growing Cells, Deltatop1 Specifically Increases Transcription Of Telomere-Proximal Genes And Decreases Glucose Utilization And Energy Production Pathways. Immunoprecipitation Data Demonstrate That Top1P Can Bind To And Is Catalytically Active At Telomeric Dna Repeats, And That Both Deltatop1 And An Inactive Y727F Top1P Mutant Increase H4 Histone Acetylation At Telomere-Proximal Regions. Interestingly, While The Y727F Mutation Has No Influence On Enzyme Recruitment To Chromatin Sites, It Has A Marked Effect On H4 K16 Acetylation At Subtelomeric Regions. The Top1P Mutation Also Increases H3 Histone K4 Dimethylation, Which Has Been Associated With Gene Transcription, At 3' Termini Of Subtelomeric Genes. No Major Effect Of Deltatop1 Or Mutation Was Detected On Sir3P Recruitment; However, Deltatop1 Has An Effect On Transcript Levels Of Genes Known To Regulate Telomeric Silencing. Thus, The Findings Indicate That Top1P Activity Can Favor Both A Repressed Chromatin Organization And A Reduced Gene Expression Level At Telomere-Proximal Regions In Yeast. As Telomere-Proximal Regions Are Known To Be Enriched For Stress-Activated Genes, Our Findings Show That Top1P Can Optimize Transcript Levels For Cell Growth In Exponentially Growing Cells Under A Synthetic Medium With Glucose.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin structure and expression of a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase III are independent of H2A.Z deposition. The Genes Transcribed By Rna Polymerase Iii (Pol Iii) Generally Have Intragenic Promoter Elements. One Of Them, The Yeast U6 Snrna (Snr6) Gene Is Activated In Vitro By A Positioned Nucleosome Between Its Intragenic Box A And Extragenic, Downstream Box B Separated By Approximately 200 Bp. We Demonstrate Here That The In Vivo Chromatin Structure Of The Gene Region Is Characterized By The Presence Of An Array Of Positioned Nucleosomes, With Only One Of Them In The 5' End Of The Gene Having A Regulatory Role. A Positioned Nucleosome Present Between Boxes A And B In Vivo Does Not Move When The Gene Is Repressed Due To Nutritional Deprivation. In Contrast, The Upstream Nucleosome Which Covers The Tata Box Under Repressed Conditions Is Shifted Approximately 50 Bp Further Upstream By The Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodeler Rsc Upon Activation. It Is Marked With The Histone Variant H2A.Z And H4K16 Acetylation In Active State. In The Absence Of H2A.Z, The Chromatin Structure Of The Gene Does Not Change, Suggesting That H2A.Z Is Not Required For Establishing The Active Chromatin Structure. These Results Show That The Chromatin Structure Directly Participates In Regulation Of A Pol Iii-Transcribed Gene Under Different States Of Its Activity In Vivo.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Stress-dependent dynamics of global chromatin remodeling in yeast: dual role for SWI/SNF in the heat shock stress response. Although Chromatin Structure Is Known To Affect Transcriptional Activity, It Is Not Clear How Broadly Patterns Of Changes In Histone Modifications And Nucleosome Occupancy Affect The Dynamic Regulation Of Transcription In Response To Perturbations. The Identity And Role Of Chromatin Remodelers That Mediate Some Of These Changes Are Also Unclear. Here, We Performed Temporal Genome-Wide Analyses Of Gene Expression, Nucleosome Occupancy, And Histone H4 Acetylation During The Response Of Yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) To Different Stresses And Report Several Findings. First, A Large Class Of Predominantly Ribosomal Protein Genes, Whose Transcription Was Repressed During Both Heat Shock And Stationary Phase, Showed Strikingly Contrasting Histone Acetylation Patterns. Second, The Swi/Snf Complex Was Required For Normal Activation As Well As Repression Of Genes During Heat Shock, And Loss Of Swi/Snf Delayed Chromatin Remodeling At The Promoters Of Activated Genes. Third, Snf2 Was Recruited To Ribosomal Protein Genes And Hsf1 Target Genes, And Its Occupancy Of This Large Set Of Genes Was Altered During Heat Shock. Our Results Suggest A Broad And Direct Dual Role For Swi/Snf In Chromatin Remodeling, During Heat Shock Activation As Well As Repression, At Promoters And Coding Regions.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Eaf1 is the platform for NuA4 molecular assembly that evolutionarily links chromatin acetylation to ATP-dependent exchange of histone H2A variants. Eaf1 (For Esa1-Associated Factor 1) And Eaf2 Have Been Identified As Stable Subunits Of Nua4, A Yeast Histone H4/H2A Acetyltransferase Complex Implicated In Gene Regulation And Dna Repair. While Both Swi3-Ada2-N-Cor-Tf Iiib Domain-Containing Proteins Are Required For Normal Cell Cycle Progression, Their Depletion Does Not Affect The Global Esa1-Dependent Acetylation Of Histones. In Contrast To All Other Subunits, Eaf1 Is Found Exclusively Associated With The Nua4 Complex In Vivo. It Serves As A Platform That Coordinates The Assembly Of Functional Groups Of Subunits Into The Native Nua4 Complex. Eaf1 Shows Structural Similarities With Human P400/Domino, A Subunit Of The Nua4-Related Tip60 Complex. On The Other Hand, P400 Also Possesses An Swi2/Snf2 Family Atpase Domain That Is Absent From The Yeast Nua4 Complex. This Domain Is Highly Related To The Yeast Swr1 Protein, Which Is Responsible For The Incorporation Of Histone Variant H2Az In Chromatin. Since All Of The Components Of The Tip60 Complex Are Homologous To Swr1 Or Nua4 Subunits, We Proposed That The Human Complex Corresponds To A Physical Merge Of Two Yeast Complexes. P400 Function In Tip60 Then Would Be Accomplished In Yeast By Cooperation Between Swr1 And Nua4. In Agreement With Such A Model, Nua4 And Swr1 Mutants Show Strong Genetic Interactions, Nua4 Affects Histone H2Az Incorporation/Acetylation In Vivo, And Both Preset The Pho5 Promoter For Activation. Interestingly, The Expression Of A Chimeric Eaf1-Swr1 Protein Recreates A Single Human-Like Complex In Yeast Cells. Our Results Identified The Key Central Subunit For The Structure And Functions Of The Nua4 Histone Acetyltransferase Complex And Functionally Linked This Activity With The Histone Variant H2Az From Yeast To Human Cells.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin-associated genes protect the yeast genome from Ty1 insertional mutagenesis. Chromosomal Genes Modulate Ty Retrotransposon Movement In The Genome Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We Have Screened A Collection Of 4739 Deletion Mutants To Identify Those That Increase Ty1 Mobility (Ty1 Restriction Genes). Among The 91 Identified Mutants, 80% Encode Products Involved In Nuclear Processes Such As Chromatin Structure And Function, Dna Repair And Recombination, And Transcription. However, Bioinformatic Analyses Encompassing Additional Ty1 And Ty3 Screens Indicate That 264 Unique Genes Involved In A Variety Of Biological Processes Affect Ty Mobility In Yeast. Further Characterization Of 33 Of The Mutants Identified Here Show That Ty1 Rna Levels Increase In 5 Mutants And The Rest Affect Mobility Post-Transcriptionally. Rna And Cdna Levels Remain Unchanged In Mutants Defective In Transcription Elongation, Including Ckb2Delta And Elf1Delta, Suggesting That Ty1 Integration May Be More Efficient In These Strains. Insertion-Site Preference At The Can1 Locus Requires Ty1 Restriction Genes Involved In Histone H2B Ubiquitination By Paf Complex Subunit Genes, As Well As Bre1 And Rad6, Histone H3 Acetylation By Rtt109 And Asf1, And Transcription Elongation By Spt5. Our Results Indicate That Multiple Pathways Restrict Ty1 Mobility And Histone Modifications May Protect Coding Regions From Insertional Mutagenesis.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad16 mediates ultraviolet-dependent histone H3 acetylation required for efficient global genome nucleotide-excision repair. In Yeast, Global Genome Nucleotide-Excision Repair (Gg-Ner) Requires A Protein Complex Containing Rad7 And Rad16. Rad16 Is A Member Of The Switch/Sucrose Nonfermentable Superfamily, And It Is Presumed That Chromatin Remodelling Is Its Primary Function During Repair. We Show That Rad16 Is Required For Ultraviolet-Dependent Hyperacetylation Of Histone H3 (Lys 9 And Lys 14) At The Mfa2 Promoter And Throughout The Genome. The Yeast Repressor Complex Ssn6-Tup1 Represses Many Genes Including Mfa2. Tup1 Deletion Results In Constitutive Hyperacetylation Of Histone H3, Nucleosome Disruption And Derepression Of Gene Transcription In Tup1-Regulated Genes. Gg-Ner In The Mfa2 Promoter Proceeds More Rapidly In Tup1Delta Alpha-Cells Compared With Wild Type, Even When Transcription Is Inhibited. We Show That Elevated Histone H3 Acetylation Levels In The Mfa2 Promoter In Tup1Delta Alpha-Cells Result In Rad7- And Rad16-Independent Gg-Ner, And That Rad16 Mediates The Ultraviolet-Induced Acetylation Of Histone H3, Necessary For Efficient Gg-Ner.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Localized H3K36 methylation states define histone H4K16 acetylation during transcriptional elongation in Drosophila. Post-Translational Modifications Of Histones Are Involved In Transcript Initiation And Elongation. Methylation Of Lysine 36 Of Histone H3 (H3K36Me) Resides Promoter Distal At Transcribed Regions In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Is Thought To Prevent Spurious Initiation Through Recruitment Of Histone-Deacetylase Activity. Here, We Report Surprising Complexity In Distribution, Regulation And Readout Of H3K36Me In Drosophila Involving Two Histone Methyltransferases (Hmtases). Dimethylation Of H3K36 Peaks Adjacent To Promoters And Requires Dmes-4, Whereas Trimethylation Accumulates Toward The 3' End Of Genes And Relies On Dhypb. Reduction Of H3K36Me3 Is Lethal In Drosophila Larvae And Leads To Elevated Levels Of Acetylation, Specifically At Lysine 16 Of Histone H4 (H4K16Ac). In Contrast, Reduction Of Both Di- And Trimethylation Decreases Lysine 16 Acetylation. Thus Di- And Trimethylation Of H3K36 Have Opposite Effects On H4K16 Acetylation, Which We Propose Enable Dynamic Changes In Chromatin Compaction During Transcript Elongation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone modifications influence the action of Snf2 family remodelling enzymes by different mechanisms. Alteration Of Chromatin Structure By Chromatin Modifying And Remodelling Activities Is A Key Stage In The Regulation Of Many Nuclear Processes. These Activities Are Frequently Interlinked, And Many Chromatin Remodelling Enzymes Contain Motifs That Recognise Modified Histones. Here We Adopt A Peptide Ligation Strategy To Generate Specifically Modified Chromatin Templates And Used These To Study The Interaction Of The Chd1, Isw2 And Rsc Remodelling Complexes With Differentially Acetylated Nucleosomes. Specific Patterns Of Histone Acetylation Are Found To Alter The Rate Of Chromatin Remodelling In Different Ways. For Example, Histone H3 Lysine 14 Acetylation Acts To Increase Recruitment Of The Rsc Complex To Nucleosomes. However, Histone H4 Tetra-Acetylation Alters The Spectrum Of Remodelled Products Generated By Increasing Octamer Transfer In Trans. In Contrast, Histone H4 Tetra-Acetylation Was Also Found To Reduce The Activity Of The Chd1 And Isw2 Remodelling Enzymes By Reducing Catalytic Turnover Without Affecting Recruitment. These Observations Illustrate A Range Of Different Means By Which Modifications To Histones Can Influence The Action Of Remodelling Enzymes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Activation of the G2/M-specific gene CLB2 requires multiple cell cycle signals. In Budding Yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae), The Periodic Expression Of The G2/M-Specific Gene Clb2 Depends On A Dna Binding Complex That Mediates Its Repression During G1 And Activation From The S Phase To The Exit Of Mitosis. The Switch From Low To High Expression Levels Depends On The Transcriptional Activator Ndd1. We Show That The Inactivation Of The Sin3 Histone Deacetylase Complex Bypasses The Essential Role Of Ndd1 In Cell Cycle Progression. Sin3 And Its Catalytic Subunit Rpd3 Associate With The Clb2 Promoter During The G1 Phase Of The Cell Cycle. Both Proteins Dissociate From The Promoter At The Onset Of The S Phase And Reassociate During G2 Phase. Sin3 Removal Coincides With A Transient Increase In Histone H4 Acetylation Followed By The Expulsion Of At Least One Nucleosome From The Promoter Region. Whereas The First Step Depends On Cdc28/Cln1 Activity, Ndd1 Function Is Required For The Second Step. Since The Removal Of Sin3 Is Independent Of Ndd1 Recruitment And Cdc28/Clb Activity It Represents A Unique Regulatory Step Which Is Distinct From Transcriptional Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Forkhead proteins control the outcome of transcription factor binding by antiactivation. Transcription Factors With Identical Dna-Binding Specificity Often Activate Different Genes In Vivo. Yeast Ace2 And Swi5 Are Such Activators, With Targets We Classify As Swi5-Only, Ace2-Only, Or Both. We Define Two Unique Regulatory Modes. Ace2 And Swi5 Both Bind In Vitro To Swi5-Only Genes Such As Ho, But Only Swi5 Binds And Activates In Vivo. In Contrast, Ace2 And Swi5 Both Bind In Vivo To Ace2-Only Genes, Such As Cts1, But Promoter-Bound Swi5 Fails To Activate. We Show That Activation By Swi5 Is Prevented By The Binding Of The Forkhead Factors Fkh1 And Fkh2, Which Recruit The Rpd3(Large) Histone Deacetylase Complex To The Cts1 Promoter. Global Analysis Shows That All Ace2-Only Genes Are Bound By Both Ace2 And Swi5, And Also By Fkh1/2. Genes Normally Activated By Either Ace2 Or Swi5 Can Be Converted To Ace2-Only Genes By The Insertion Of Fkh-Binding Sites. Thus Fkh Proteins, Which Function Initially To Activate Swi5 And Ace2, Subsequently Function As Swi5-Specific Antiactivators.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Association with the origin recognition complex suggests a novel role for histone acetyltransferase Hat1p/Hat2p. Histone Modifications Have Been Implicated In The Regulation Of Transcription And, More Recently, In Dna Replication And Repair. In Yeast, A Major Conserved Histone Acetyltransferase, Hat1P, Preferentially Acetylates Lysine Residues 5 And 12 On Histone H4.Here, We Report That A Nuclear Sub-Complex Consisting Of Hat1P And Its Partner Hat2P Interacts Physically And Functionally With The Origin Recognition Complex (Orc). While Mutational Inactivation Of The Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Gene Hat1 Alone Does Not Compromise Origin Firing Or Initiation Of Dna Replication, A Deletion In Hat1 (Or Hat2) Exacerbates The Growth Defects Of Conditional Orc-Ts Mutants. Thus, The Orc-Associated Hat1P-Dependent Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Suggests A Novel Linkage Between Histone Modification And Dna Replication. Additional Genetic And Biochemical Evidence Points To The Existence Of Partly Overlapping Histone H3 Acetyltransferase Activities In Addition To Hat1P/Hat2P For Proper Dna Replication Efficiency. Furthermore, We Demonstrated A Dynamic Association Of Hat1P With Chromatin During S-Phase That Suggests A Role Of This Enzyme At The Replication Fork.We Have Found An Intriguing New Association Of The Hat1P-Dependent Histone Acetyltransferase In Addition To Its Previously Known Role In Nuclear Chromatin Assembly (Hat1P/Hat2P-Hif1P). The Participation Of A Distinct Hat1P/Hat2P Sub-Complex Suggests A Linkage Of Histone H4 Modification With Orc-Dependent Dna Replication.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone modifications in Trypanosoma brucei. Several Biological Processes In Trypanosoma Brucei Are Affected By Chromatin Structure, Including Gene Expression, Cell Cycle Regulation, And Life-Cycle Stage Differentiation. In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Other Organisms, Chromatin Structure Is Dependent Upon Posttranslational Modifications Of Histones, Which Have Been Mapped In Detail. The Tails Of The Four Core Histones Of T. Brucei Are Highly Diverged From Those Of Mammals And Yeasts, So Sites Of Potential Modification Cannot Be Reliably Inferred, And No Cross-Species Antibodies Are Available To Map The Modifications. We Therefore Undertook An Extensive Survey To Identify Posttranslational Modifications By Edman Degradation And Mass Spectrometry. Edman Analysis Showed That The N-Terminal Alanine Of H2A, H2B, And H4 Could Be Monomethylated. We Found That The Histone H4 N-Terminus Is Heavily Modified, While, In Contrast To Other Organisms, The Histone H2A And H2B N-Termini Have Relatively Few Modifications. Histone H3 Appears To Have A Number Of Modifications At The N-Terminus, But We Were Unable To Assign Many Of These To A Specific Amino Acid. Therefore, We Focused Our Efforts On Uncovering Modification States Of H4. We Discuss The Potential Relevance Of These Modifications.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The SAGA continues: expanding the cellular role of a transcriptional co-activator complex. Throughout The Last Decade, Great Advances Have Been Made In Our Understanding Of How Dna-Templated Cellular Processes Occur In The Native Chromatin Environment. Proteins That Regulate Transcription, Replication, Dna Repair, Mitosis And Other Processes Must Be Targeted To Specific Regions Of The Genome And Granted Access To Dna, Which Is Normally Tightly Packaged In The Higher-Order Chromatin Structure Of Eukaryotic Nuclei. Massive Multiprotein Complexes Have Been Discovered, Which Facilitate Access To Dna And Recruitment Of Downstream Effectors Through Three Distinct Mechanisms: Chemical Modification Of Histone Amino-Acid Residues, Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling And Histone Exchange. The Yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl Transferase (Saga) Transcriptional Co-Activator Complex Regulates Numerous Cellular Processes Through Coordination Of Multiple Histone Post-Translational Modifications. Saga Is Known To Generate And Interact With A Number Of Histone Modifications, Including Acetylation, Methylation, Ubiquitylation And Phosphorylation. Although Best Characterized For Its Role In Regulating Transcriptional Activation, Saga Is Also Required For Optimal Transcription Elongation, Mrna Export And Perhaps Nucleotide Excision Repair. Here, We Discuss Findings From Recent Years That Have Elucidated The Function Of This 1.8-Mda Complex In Multiple Cellular Processes, And How Misregulation Of The Homologous Complexes In Humans May Ultimately Play A Role In Development Of Disease.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The Sas3p and Gcn5p histone acetyltransferases are recruited to similar genes. Specific Histone Modifications Can Perform Several Cellular Functions, For Example, As Signals To Recruit Trans-Acting Factors And As Modulators Of Chromatin Structure. Acetylation Of Lys14 Of Histone H3 Is The Main Target Of Many Histone Acetyltransferases In Vitro And May Play A Central Role In The Stability Of The Nucleosome. This Study Is Focused On The Genome-Wide Binding Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Histone Acetyltransferases That Are Specific For Lys14 Of Histone H3.We Have Used A Variation Of The Genome-Wide Location Analysis Method, Based On A Macroarray Platform, To Identify Binding Sites Of Yeast Histone Acetyltransferase Catalytic Subunits And To Correlate Their Positions With Acetylation Of Lys14 Of Histone H3. Our Results Revealed That The Histone Acetyltransferases Sas3P And Gcn5P Are Recruited To A Pool Of Intensely Transcribed Genes And That There Is Considerable Overlap Between The Two Cohorts Of Sas3P And Gcn5P Bound Gene Pools. We Also Demonstrate A Positive Correlation Between Binding Sites Of Both Proteins And The Acetylation State Of Lys14 Of Histone H3. Finally, A Positive Correlation Between The Decrease Of H3 Lys14 Acetylation In A Gcn5 Deleted Strain And The Gcn5P Genome Occupancy Is Shown.Our Data Support A Model In Which Both Gcn5P And Sas3P Act As General Activators Of An Overlapping Pool Of Intensely Transcribed Genes. Since Both Proteins Preferentially Acetylate Lys14 Of Histone H3, Our Data Support The Hypothesis That Acetylation Of This Specific Residue Facilitates The Action Of The Transcriptional Apparatus.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	GC- and AT-rich chromatin domains differ in conformation and histone modification status and are differentially modulated by Rpd3p. Base-Composition Varies Throughout The Genome And Is Related To Organization Of Chromosomes In Distinct Domains (Isochores). Isochore Domains Differ In Gene Expression Levels, Replication Timing, Levels Of Meiotic Recombination And Chromatin Structure. The Molecular Basis For These Differences Is Poorly Understood.We Have Compared Gc- And At-Rich Isochores Of Yeast With Respect To Chromatin Conformation, Histone Modification Status And Transcription. Using 3C Analysis We Show That, Along Chromosome Iii, Gc-Rich Isochores Have A Chromatin Structure That Is Characterized By Lower Chromatin Interaction Frequencies Compared To At-Rich Isochores, Which May Point To A More Extended Chromatin Conformation. In Addition, We Find That Throughout The Genome, Gc-Rich And At-Rich Genes Display Distinct Levels Of Histone Modifications. Interestingly, Elimination Of The Histone Deacetylase Rpd3P Differentially Affects Conformation Of Gc- And At-Rich Domains. Further, Deletion Of Rpd3 Activates Expression Of Gc-Rich Genes More Strongly Than At-Rich Genes. Analyses Of Effects Of The Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Trichostatin A, Global Patterns Of Rpd3P Binding And Effects Of Deletion Of Rpd3 On Histone H4 Acetylation Confirmed That Conformation And Activity Of Gc-Rich Chromatin Are More Sensitive To Rpd3P-Mediated Deacetylation Than At-Rich Chromatin.We Find That Gc-Rich And At-Rich Chromatin Domains Display Distinct Chromatin Conformations And Are Marked By Distinct Patterns Of Histone Modifications. We Identified The Histone Deacetylase Rpd3P As An Attenuator Of These Base Composition-Dependent Differences In Chromatin Status. We Propose That Gc-Rich Chromatin Domains Tend To Occur In A More Active Conformation And That Rpd3P Activity Represses This Propensity Throughout The Genome.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Infrequently transcribed long genes depend on the Set2/Rpd3S pathway for accurate transcription. The Presence Of Set2-Mediated Methylation Of H3K36 (K36Me) Correlates With Transcription Frequency Throughout The Yeast Genome. K36Me Targets The Rpd3S Complex To Deacetylate Transcribed Regions And Suppress Cryptic Transcription Initiation At Certain Genes. Here, Using A Genome-Wide Approach, We Report That The Set2-Rpd3S Pathway Is Generally Required For Controlling Acetylation At Coding Regions. When Using Acetylation As A Functional Readout For This Pathway, We Discovered That Longer Genes And, Surprisingly, Genes Transcribed At Lower Frequency Exhibit A Stronger Dependency. Moreover, A Systematic Screen Using High-Resolution Tiling Microarrays Allowed Us To Identify A Group Of Genes That Rely On Set2-Rpd3S To Suppress Spurious Transcripts. Interestingly, Most Of These Genes Are Within The Group That Depend On The Same Pathway To Maintain A Hypoacetylated State At Coding Regions. These Data Highlight The Importance Of Using The Functional Readout Of Histone Codes To Define The Roles Of Specific Pathways.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Coordinated regulation of growth genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It Is Imperative That Quiescent Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Cells Respond Rapidly To Fresh Medium: The Cell That Initiates Growth And Division Soonest Has The Most Progeny. Several Laboratories Have Used Dna Microarrays To Identify Transcripts That Are Altered When Fresh Medium Is Added To Quiescent Cells. We Combined Published Data With Our Own To Address Several Questions: Do These Experiments Taken Together Identify A Core Set Of Genes That Is Reproducibly Affected When Quiescent Cells Are Stimulated By Nutrient Repletion? Is This Gene Set Coregulated In Response To Other Environmental Challenges? Does Promoter Histone Occupancy Correlate With The Mrna Data? Despite Diverse Experimental Designs, The Data Were Highly Correlated, Generating A Set Of Nutrient Repletion Transcripts. Glucose Addition Accounted For The Response. These Transcripts Were Also Coregulated In Response To Diverse Stresses. Promoters Were Associated With Increased Histone Acetylation And Decreased Histone Occupancy When Induced, And High Histone Occupancy With Low Acetylation When Repressed. The Presence Of Rrpe And Pac Promoter Elements Correlated With Nutrient Responsiveness And A Dynamic Pattern Of Histone Occupancy And Acetylation. Correlative Evidence Supports The Idea That Some Mrnas May Be Upregulated By Release From Sequestration In Rna-Protein Complexes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The Rtt109-Vps75 histone acetyltransferase complex acetylates non-nucleosomal histone H3. Acetylation Of Lysine 56 Of Histone H3 (H3-Lys-56) Occurs In S Phase And Disappears During G(2)/M Phase Of The Cell Cycle. However, It Is Not Clear How This Modification Is Regulated During The Progression Of The Cell Cycle. We And Others Have Shown That The Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Rtt109 Is The Primary Hat Responsible For Acetylating H3-Lys-56 In Budding Yeast. Here We Show That Rtt109 Forms A Complex With Vps75 And That Both Recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 Complexes And Native Complexes Purified From Yeast Cells Acetylate H3 Present In H3/H4/H2A/H2B Core Histones But Not Other Histones. In Addition, Both Recombinant And Native Rtt109-Vps75 Hat Complexes Exhibited No Detectable Activity Toward Nucleosomal H3, Suggesting That H3-Lys-56 Acetylation Is At Least In Part Regulated By The Inability Of Rtt109-Vps75 Complexes To Acetylate Nucleosomal H3 During G(2)/M Phase Of The Cell Cycle. Further, Rtt109 Bound Mutant H3/H4 Tetramers Composed Of Histones Lacking Their N-Terminal Tail Domains Less Efficiently Than Wild-Type H3/H4 Tetramers, And Rtt109-Vps75 Complexes Displayed Reduced Hat Activity Toward These Mutant H3/H4 Tetramers. Thus, The N Termini Of H3/H4 Tetramers Are Required For Efficient Acetylation Of H3 By The Rtt109-Vps75 Complex. Taken Together, These Studies Provide Insights Into How H3-Lys-56 Acetylation Is Regulated During The Cell Cycle.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Multi-tasking on chromatin with the SAGA coactivator complexes. Over The Past 10 Years, Much Progress Has Been Made To Understand The Roles Of The Similar, Yet Distinct Yeast Saga And Slik Coactivator Complexes Involved In Histone Post-Translational Modification And Gene Regulation. Many Different Groups Have Elucidated Functions Of The Saga Complexes Including Identification Of Novel Components, Which Have Conferred Additional Distinct Functions. Together, Recent Studies Demonstrate Unique Attributes Of The Saga Coactivator Complexes In Histone Acetylation, Methylation, Phosphorylation, And Deubiquitination. In Addition To Roles In Transcriptional Activation With The 19S Proteasome Regulatory Particle, Recent Evidence Also Suggests Functions For Saga In Elongation And Mrna Export. The Modular Nature Of Saga Allows This Approximately 1.8 Mda Complex To Organize Its Functions And Carry Out Multiple Roles During Transcription, Particularly Under Conditions Of Cellular Stress.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Expression and purification of recombinant yeast Ada2/Ada3/Gcn5 and Piccolo NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complexes. Acetylation Of Histone Tails By Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Enzymes Is A Key Post-Translational Modification Of Histones Associated With Transcriptionally Active Genes. Acetylation Of The Physiological Nucleosome Substrate Is Performed In Cells By Megadalton Complexes Such As Saga And Nua4. To Understand How Hat Enzymes Specifically Recognize Their Nucleosome And Not Just Histone Tail Substrates, We Have Identified The Catalytic Saga And Nua4 Subcomplexes Sufficient To Act On Nucleosomes. We Describe Here Expression And Purification Procedures To Prepare Recombinant Yeast Ada2/Ada3/Gcn5 Subcomplex Of Saga Which Acetylates Histones H3 And H2B On Nucleosomes, And The Piccolo Nua4 Complex Which Acetylates Histones H4 And H2A On Nucleosomes. We Demonstrate An Unexpected Benefit Of Using The Bl21-Codonplus Strain To Enhance The Purity Of Metal Affinity Purified Ada2/Ada3/Gcn5 Complex. We Also Identify Escherichia Coli Ef-Tu As A Contaminant That Copurifies With Both Complexes Over Multiple Chromatographic Steps And Use Of Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography To Remove The Contaminant From The Piccolo Nua4 Complex. The Methods Described Here Will Be Useful For Studies Into The Molecular Mechanism Of These Enzymes And For Preparing The Enzymes As Reagents To Study The Interplay Of Nucleosome Acetylation With Other Chromatin Modification And Remodeling Enzymes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone deacetylases RPD3 and HOS2 regulate the transcriptional activation of DNA damage-inducible genes. Dna Microarray And Genetic Studies Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Have Demonstrated That Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Are Required For Transcriptional Activation And Repression, But The Mechanism By Which They Activate Transcription Remains Poorly Understood. We Show That Two Hdacs, Rpd3 And Hos2, Are Required For The Activation Of Dna Damage-Inducible Genes Rnr3 And Hug1. Using Mutants Specific For The Rpd3L Complex, We Show That The Complex Is Responsible For Regulating Rnr3. Furthermore, Unlike What Was Described For The Gal Genes, Rpd3L Regulates The Activation Of Rnr3 By Deacetylating Nucleosomes At The Promoter, Not At The Open Reading Frame. Rpd3 Is Recruited To The Upstream Repression Sequence Of Rnr3, Which Surprisingly Does Not Require Tup1 Or Crt1. Chromatin Remodeling And Tfiid Recruitment Are Largely Unaffected In The Deltarpd3/Deltahos2 Mutant, But The Recruitment Of Rna Polymerase Ii Is Strongly Reduced, Arguing That Rpd3 And Hos2 Regulate Later Stages In The Assembly Of The Preinitiation Complex Or Facilitate Multiple Rounds Of Polymerase Recruitment. Furthermore, The Histone H4 Acetyltransferase Esa1 Is Required For The Activation Of Rnr3 And Hug1. Thus, Reduced Or Unregulated Constitutive Histone H4 Acetylation Is Detrimental To Promoter Activity, Suggesting That Hdac-Dependent Mechanisms Are In Place To Reset Promoters To Allow High Levels Of Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Gcn5 promotes acetylation, eviction, and methylation of nucleosomes in transcribed coding regions. We Report That Coactivator Saga, Containing The Hat Gcn5P, Occupies The Gal1 And Arg1 Coding Sequences During Transcriptional Induction, Dependent On Pic Assembly And Ser5 Phosphorylation Of The Pol Ii Ctd. Induction Of Gal1 Increases H3 Acetylation Per Nucleosome In The Orf, Dependent On Saga Integrity But Not The Alternative Gcn5P-Hat Complex Ada. Unexpectedly, H3 Acetylation In Arg1 Coding Sequences Does Not Increase During Induction Due To The Opposing Activities Of Multiple Hdas Associated With The Orf. Remarkably, Inactivation Of Gcn5P Decreases Nucleosome Eviction From Both Gal1 And A Long ( Approximately 8 Kb) Orf Transcribed From The Gal1 Promoter. This Is Associated With Reduced Pol Ii Occupancy At The 3' End And Decreased Mrna Production, Selectively, For The Long Orf. Gcn5P Also Enhances H3-K4 Trimethylation In The Arg1 Orf And Bulk Histones. Thus, Gcn5P, Most Likely In Saga, Stimulates Modification And Eviction Of Nucleosomes In Transcribed Coding Sequences And Promotes Pol Ii Elongation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation: a new twist in the chromosome cycle. Several Recent Reports Have Identified Lysine 56 (K56) As A Novel Site Of Acetylation In Yeast Histone H3. K56 Acetylation Is Predicted To Disrupt Some Of The Histone-Dna Interactions At The Entry And Exit Points Of The Nucleosome Core Particle. This Modification Occurs In Virtually All The Newly Synthesised Histones That Are Deposited Into Chromatin During S-Phase. Cells With Mutations That Block K56 Acetylation Show Increased Genome Instability And Hypersensitivity To Genotoxic Agents That Interfere With Replication. Removal Of K56 Acetylation Takes Place In The G2/M Phase Of The Cell Cycle And Is Dependent Upon Hst3 And Hst4, Two Proteins That Are Related To The Nad+-Dependent Histone Deacetylase Sir2. In Response To Dna Damage Checkpoint Activation During S-Phase, Expression Of Hst3/Hst4 Is Delayed To Extend The Window Of Opportunity In Which K56 Acetylation Can Act In The Dna Damage Response. The High Abundance Of Histone H3 K56 Acetylation, Its Regulation And Strategic Location In The Nucleosome Core Particle Raise A Number Of Fascinating Issues That We Discuss Here.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Interplay between chromatin and trans-acting factors on the IME2 promoter upon induction of the gene at the onset of meiosis. The Ime2 Gene Is One Of The Key Regulators Of The Initiation Of Meiosis In Budding Yeast. This Gene Is Repressed During Mitosis Through The Repressive Chromatin Structure At The Promoter, Which Is Maintained By The Rpd3-Sin3 Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Complex. Ime2 Expression In Meiosis Requires Gcn5/Histone Acetyltransferase, The Transcriptional Activator Ime1, And The Chromatin Remodeler Rsc; However, The Molecular Basis Of Ime2 Activation Had Not Been Previously Defined. We Found That, During Mitotic Growth, A Nucleosome Masked The Tata Element Of Ime2, And This Positioning Depended On Hdac. This Chromatin Structure Was Remodeled At Meiosis By Rsc That Was Recruited To Tata By Ime1. Stable Tethering Of Ime1 To The Promoter Required The Presence Of Gcn5. Interestingly, Ime1 Binding To The Promoter Was Kept At Low Levels During The Very Early Stages In Meiosis, Even When The Levels Of Ime1 And Histone H3 Acetylation At The Promoter Were At Their Highest, Making A 4- To 6-H Delay Of The Ime2 Expression From That Of Ime1. Hdac Was Continuously Present At The Promoter Regardless Of The Transcriptional Condition Of Ime2, And Deletion Of Rpd3 Allowed The Ime2 Expression Shortly After The Expression Of Ime1, Suggesting That Hdac Plays A Role In Regulating The Timing Of Ime2 Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Yng1 PHD finger binding to H3 trimethylated at K4 promotes NuA3 HAT activity at K14 of H3 and transcription at a subset of targeted ORFs. Posttranslational Histone Modifications Participate In Modulating The Structure And Function Of Chromatin. Promoters Of Transcribed Genes Are Enriched With K4 Trimethylation And Hyperacetylation On The N-Terminal Tail Of Histone H3. Recently, Phd Finger Proteins, Like Yng1 In The Nua3 Hat Complex, Were Shown To Interact With H3K4Me3, Indicating A Biochemical Link Between K4 Methylation And Hyperacetylation. By Using A Combination Of Mass Spectrometry, Biochemistry, And Nmr, We Detail The Yng1 Phd-H3K4Me3 Interaction And The Importance Of Nua3-Dependent Acetylation At K14. Furthermore, Genome-Wide Chip-Chip Analysis Demonstrates Colocalization Of Yng1 And H3K4Me3 In Vivo. Disrupting The K4Me3 Binding Of Yng1 Altered K14Ac And Transcription At Certain Genes, Thereby Demonstrating Direct In Vivo Evidence Of Sequential Trimethyl Binding, Acetyltransferase Activity, And Gene Regulation By Nua3. Our Data Support A General Mechanism Of Transcriptional Control Through Which Histone Acetylation Upstream Of Gene Activation Is Promoted Partially Through Availability Of H3K4Me3, "Read" By Binding Modules In Select Subunits.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Taking it off: regulation of H3 K56 acetylation by Hst3 and Hst4. Histone Modifications Have Been Implicated In Both Dna Repair And Checkpoint-Mediated Responses To Dna Damage. Recently Much Attention Has Focused On The Acetylation Of H3 K56. Indeed, This Modification Is Cell Cycle-Regulated, Maintained Upon Replicative Damage In A Checkpoint-Dependent Manner, And Is Essential For Surviving Dna Damage. We And Others Have Discovered That Two Members Of The Hdac Sirtuin Family, Hst3 And Hst4, Negatively Regulate H3 K56 Acetylation In Budding Yeast. Additionally, We Have Shown That These Two Hdacs Are Targeted For Repression By The Dna Damage Checkpoint, Which Is Vital For Dna Damage Tolerance. Discovery That Two Hdacs Are Negative Regulators Of The Cellular Response To Dna Damage And That They Target The Acetylation Of H3 K56 Reveals A Complex Relationship Between Histone Modifications, Hdacs, And The Dna Damage Response. Here, We Discuss The Recent Reports Of The Regulation Of H3 K56-Ac By Hst3 And Hst4 And Put Forth The Critical Questions That Remain For Understanding The Intimate, Though Poorly Characterized, Connection Between Chromatin States And Genomic Maintenance.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Deletion of the chromatin remodeling gene SPT10 sensitizes yeast cells to a subclass of DNA-damaging agents. The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Spt10 Protein Possesses A Dna-Binding Domain That Is Fused To A Putative Histone Acetyltransferase Domain. It Binds Specifically To Upstream-Activating Sequence Elements In The Core Histone Promoters And Plays A Direct Role In Histone Gene Regulation. Spt10 Is Also Required For Cell-Cycle-Specific K56 Acetylation At Histone Genes, Allowing The Recruitment Of The Nucleosome Remodeling Factor Snf5 And Subsequent Regulation Of Gene Transcription. We Reisolated The Spt10 Gene In A Functional Genome-Wide Screen Designed To Identify Haploid Yeast Mutants That Are Hypersensitive To The Antitumor Drug Bleomycin, Which Acts By Damaging Dna. In Addition To Bleomycin, We Show That Spt10Delta Mutants Are Also Hypersensitive To A Limited Set Of Genotoxic Agents That Create Dna Strand Breaks, But Not To 254-Nm Ultraviolet Light Or 4-Nitroquinoline-1-Oxide, Which Generate Helix Distortion. The Hypersensitivities Of The Spt10Delta Mutant To The Genotoxic Agents Are Rescued By A Single Copy Plasmid Carrying The Spt10 Gene. We Further Showed That Spt10Delta Mutants Displayed A Modest Twofold Increase Spontaneous Mutant Frequency, As Compared To The Parent. Following Exposure To Bleomycin, These Mutants Accumulate Unrepaired Lesions, E.G., Dna Strand Breaks With Blocked 3'-Ends In The Chromosomal Dna. This Defect Is Not Due To The Altered Expression Level Or The Enzymatic Activities Of A Key Dna Repair Enzyme, Apn1, Which Is Known To Repair Dna Strand Breaks With Blocked Ends. We Propose That Spt10 Mediates Repair Of A Subset Of Dna Lesions By Acetylating Histones To Promote Recruitment Of Dna Repair Enzymes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The Drosophila histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 and transcriptional adaptor Ada2a are involved in nucleosomal histone H4 acetylation. The Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Gcn5 Plays A Role In Chromatin Structure And Gene Expression Regulation As A Catalytic Component Of Multiprotein Complexes, Some Of Which Also Contain Ada2-Type Transcriptional Coactivators. Data Obtained Mostly From Studies On Yeast (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae) Suggest That Ada2 Potentiates Gcn5 Activity And Substrate Recognition. Dada2B, One Of Two Related Ada2 Proteins Of Drosophila Melanogaster, Was Recently Found To Play A Role In Complexes Acetylating Histone 3 (H3). Evidence Of An In Vivo Functional Link Between The Related Coactivator Dada2A And Dgcn5, However, Is Lacking. Here We Present Data On The Genetic Interaction Of Dgcn5 And Dada2A. The Loss Of Either Dgcn5 Or Dada2A Function Results In Similar Chromosome Structural And Developmental Defects. In Dada2A Mutants, The Nucleosomal H4 Acetylation At Lysines 12 And 5 Is Significantly Reduced, While The Acetylation Established By Dada2B-Containing Gcn5 Complexes At H3 Lysines 9 And 14 Is Unaffected. The Data Presented Here, Together With Our Earlier Data On The Function Of Dada2B, Provide Evidence That Related Ada2 Proteins Of Drosophila, Together With Gcn5 Hat, Are Involved In The Acetylation Of Specific Lysine Residues In The N-Terminal Tails Of Nucleosomal H3 And H4. Our Data Suggest Dada2A Involvement In Both Uniformly Distributed H4 Acetylation And Gene-Specific Transcription Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The KAP1 corepressor functions to coordinate the assembly of de novo HP1-demarcated microenvironments of heterochromatin required for KRAB zinc finger protein-mediated transcriptional repression. Kap1/Tif1Beta Is Proposed To Be A Universal Corepressor Protein For The Krab Zinc Finger Protein (Krab-Zfp) Superfamily Of Transcriptional Repressors. To Characterize The Role Of Kap1 And Kap1-Interacting Proteins In Transcriptional Repression, We Investigated The Regulation Of Stably Integrated Reporter Transgenes By Hormone-Responsive Krab And Kap1 Repressor Proteins. Here, We Demonstrate That Depletion Of Endogenous Kap1 Levels By Small Interfering Rna (Sirna) Significantly Inhibited Krab-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Of A Chromatin Template. Similarly, Reduction In Cellular Levels Of Hp1Alpha/Beta/Gamma And Setdb1 By Sirna Attenuated Krab-Kap1 Repression. We Also Found That Direct Tethering Of Kap1 To Dna Was Sufficient To Repress Transcription Of An Integrated Transgene. This Activity Is Absolutely Dependent Upon The Interaction Of Kap1 With Hp1 And On An Intact Phd Finger And Bromodomain Of Kap1, Suggesting That These Domains Function Cooperatively In Transcriptional Corepression. The Achievement Of The Repressed State By Wild-Type Kap1 Involves Decreased Recruitment Of Rna Polymerase Ii, Reduced Levels Of Histone H3 K9 Acetylation And H3K4 Methylation, An Increase In Histone Occupancy, Enrichment Of Trimethyl Histone H3K9, H3K36, And Histone H4K20, And Hp1 Deposition At Proximal Regulatory Sequences Of The Transgene. A Kap1 Protein Containing A Mutation Of The Hp1 Binding Domain Failed To Induce Any Change In The Histone Modifications Associated With Dna Sequences Of The Transgene, Implying That Hp1-Directed Nuclear Compartmentalization Is Required For Transcriptional Repression By The Krab/Kap1 Repression Complex. The Combination Of These Data Suggests That Kap1 Functions To Coordinate Activities That Dynamically Regulate Changes In Histone Modifications And Deposition Of Hp1 To Establish A De Novo Microenvironment Of Heterochromatin, Which Is Required For Repression Of Gene Transcription By Krab-Zfps.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Reuniting the contrasting functions of H2A.Z. It Is Now Well Established That Cells Modify Chromatin To Set Transcriptionally Active Or Inactive Regions. Such Control Of Chromatin Structure Is Essential For Proper Development Of Organisms. In Addition To The Growing Number Of Histone Post-Translational Modifications, Cells Can Exchange Canonical Histones With Different Variants That Can Directly Or Indirectly Change Chromatin Structure. Moreover, Enzymatic Complexes That Can Exchange Specific Histone Variants Within The Nucleosome Have Now Been Identified. One Such Variant, H2A.Z, Has Recently Been The Focus Of Many Studies. H2A.Z Is Highly Conserved In Evolution And Has Many Different Functions, While Defining Both Active And Inactive Chromatin In Different Contexts. Advanced Molecular Techniques, Such As Genome-Wide Binding Assays (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation On Chip) Have Recently Given Researchers Many Clues As To How H2A.Z Is Targeted To Chromatin And How It Affects Nuclear Functions. We Wish To Review The Recent Literature And Summarize Our Understanding Of The Mechanisms And Functions Of H2A.Z.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Long-range histone acetylation: biological significance, structural implications, and mechanisms. Genomic Characterization Of Various Euchromatic Regions In Higher Eukaryotes Has Revealed That Domain-Wide Hyperacetylation (Over Several Kb) Occurs At A Range Of Loci, Including Individual Genes, Gene Family Clusters, Compound Clusters, And More General Clusters Of Unrelated Genes. Patterns Of Long-Range Histone Hyperacetylation Are Strictly Conserved Within Each Unique Cellular System Studied And They Reflect Biological Variability In Gene Regulation. Domain-Wide Histone Acetylation Consists Generally Of Nonuniform Peaks Of Enriched Hyperacetylation Of Specific Core Histones, Histone Isoforms, And (Or) Histone Variants Against A Backdrop Of Nonspecific Acetylation Across The Domain In Question. Here We Review The Characteristics Of Long-Range Histone Acetylation In Some Higher Eukaryotes And Draw Special Attention To Recent Literature On The Multiple Effects That Histone Hyperacetylation Has On Chromatin'S Structural Integrity And How They Affect Transcription. These Include The Thermal, Ionic, Cumulative, And Isoform-Specific (H4 K16) Consequences Of Acetylation That Result In A More Dynamic Core Complex And Chromatin Fiber.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Gcn5p contributes to the bidirectional character of the UGA3-GLT1 yeast promoter. Analysis Of The Uga3-Glt1 Bidirectional Promoter Has Indicated That Its Transcriptional Activation Is Determined By The Combined Action Of Gcn4P And Gln3P, And That Its Bidirectional Character Is Influenced By Chromatin Organization, Through The Action Of An Abf1P Binding Site And A Polydadttract. Results Presented In This Paper Show That Lack Of Gcn5P Impairs Histone Acetylation And Nucleosomal Organization Of The Uga3-Glt1 Promoter, Resulting In An Asymmetrical Transcriptional Activation Response Of Uga3 And Glt1. The Phenotype Displayed By A Double Mutant Impaired In Gcn5 And In The Abf1P Binding Site Indicates That The Combined Action Of These Two Elements Determines The Bidirectional Capacity Of The Uga3-Glt1 Intergenic Region.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Isw1 functions in parallel with the NuA4 and Swr1 complexes in stress-induced gene repression. The Packaging Of Dna Into Chromatin Allows Eukaryotic Cells To Organize And Compact Their Genomes But Also Creates An Environment That Is Generally Repressive To Nuclear Processes That Depend Upon Dna Accessibility. There Are Several Classes Of Enzymes That Modulate The Primary Structure Of Chromatin To Regulate Various Dna-Dependent Processes. The Biochemical Activities Of The Yeast Isw1 Atp-Dependent Chromatin-Remodeling Enzyme Have Been Well Characterized In Vitro, But Little Is Known About How These Activities Are Utilized In Vivo. In This Work, We Sought To Discern Genetic Backgrounds That Require Isw1 Activity For Normal Growth. We Identified A Three-Way Genetic Interaction Among Isw1, The Nua4 Histone Acetyltransferase Complex, And The Swr1 Histone Replacement Complex. Transcription Microarray Analysis Revealed Parallel Functions For These Three Chromatin-Modifying Factors In The Regulation Of Tata-Containing Genes, Including The Repression Of A Large Number Of Stress-Induced Genes Under Normal Growth Conditions. In Contrast To A Recruitment-Based Model, We Find That The Nua4 And Swr1 Complexes Act Throughout The Genome While Only A Specific Subset Of The Genome Shows Alterations In Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Nucleocytosolic acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase is required for histone acetylation and global transcription. Metabolic Enzymes Rarely Regulate Informational Processes Like Gene Expression. Yeast Acetyl-Coa Synthetases (Acs1P And 2P) Are Exceptional, As They Are Important Not Only For Carbon Metabolism But Also Are Shown Here To Supply The Acetyl-Coa For Histone Acetylation By Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats). Acs2-Ts Mutants Exhibit Global Histone Deacetylation, Transcriptional Defects, And Synthetic Growth Defects With Hat Mutants At High Temperatures. In Glycerol With Ethanol, Acs1P Is An Alternate Acetyl-Coa Source For Hats. Rapid Deacetylation After Acs2P Inactivation Suggests Nuclear Acetyl-Coa Synthesis Is Rate Limiting For Histone Acetylation. Different Histone Lysines Exhibit Distinct Deacetylation Rates, With N-Terminal Tail Lysines Deacetylated Rapidly And H3 Lysine 56 Slowly. Yeast Mitochondrial And Nucleocytosolic Acetyl-Coa Pools Are Biochemically Isolated. Thus, Acetyl-Coa Metabolism Is Directly Linked To Chromatin Regulation And May Affect Diverse Cellular Processes In Which Acetylation And Metabolism Intersect, Such As Disease States And Aging.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin modifications by methylation and ubiquitination: implications in the regulation of gene expression. It Is More Evident Now Than Ever That Nucleosomes Can Transmit Epigenetic Information From One Cell Generation To The Next. It Has Been Demonstrated During The Past Decade That The Posttranslational Modifications Of Histone Proteins Within The Chromosome Impact Chromatin Structure, Gene Transcription, And Epigenetic Information. Multiple Modifications Decorate Each Histone Tail Within The Nucleosome, Including Some Amino Acids That Can Be Modified In Several Different Ways. Covalent Modifications Of Histone Tails Known Thus Far Include Acetylation, Phosphorylation, Sumoylation, Ubiquitination, And Methylation. A Large Body Of Experimental Evidence Compiled During The Past Several Years Has Demonstrated The Impact Of Histone Acetylation On Transcriptional Control. Although Histone Modification By Methylation And Ubiquitination Was Discovered Long Ago, It Was Only Recently That Functional Roles For These Modifications In Transcriptional Regulation Began To Surface. Highlighted In This Review Are The Recent Biochemical, Molecular, Cellular, And Physiological Functions Of Histone Methylation And Ubiquitination Involved In The Regulation Of Gene Expression As Determined By A Combination Of Enzymological, Structural, And Genetic Methodologies.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	SWI/SNF binding to the HO promoter requires histone acetylation and stimulates TATA-binding protein recruitment. We Use Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays To Show That The Gcn5 Histone Acetyltransferase In Saga Is Required For Swi/Snf Association With The Ho Promoter And That Binding Of Swi/Snf And Saga Are Interdependent. Previous Results Showed That Swi/Snf Binding To Ho Was Gcn5 Independent, But That Work Used A Strain With A Mutation In The Ash1 Daughter-Specific Repressor Of Ho Expression. Here, We Show That Ash1 Functions As A Repressor That Inhibits Swi/Snf Binding And That Gcn5 Is Required To Overcome Ash1 Repression In Mother Cells To Allow Ho Transcription. Thus, Gcn5 Facilitates Swi/Snf Binding By Antagonizing Ash1. Similarly, A Mutation In Sin3, Like An Ash1 Mutation, Allows Both Ho Expression And Swi/Snf Binding In The Absence Of Gcn5. Although Ash1 Has Recently Been Identified In A Sin3-Rpd3 Complex, Our Genetic Analysis Shows That Ash1 And Sin3 Have Distinct Functions In Regulating Ho. Analysis Of Mutant Strains Shows That Swi/Snf Binding And Ho Expression Are Correlated And Regulated By Histone Acetylation. The Defect In Ho Expression Caused By A Mutant Swi/Snf With A Swi2(E834K) Substitution Can Be Partially Suppressed By Ash1 Or Spt3 Mutation Or By A Gain-Of-Function V71E Substitution In The Tata-Binding Protein (Tbp). Spt3 Inhibits Tbp Binding At Ho, And Genetic Analysis Suggests That Spt3 And Tbp(V71E) Act In The Same Pathway, Distinct From That Of Ash1. We Have Detected Swi/Snf Binding At The Ho Tata Region, And Our Results Suggest That Swi/Snf, Either Directly Or Indirectly, Facilitates Tbp Binding At Ho.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Independent recruitment of mediator and SAGA by the activator Met4. Mediator Is A Key Rna Polymerase Ii (Pol Ii) Cofactor In The Regulation Of Eukaryotic Gene Expression. It Is Believed To Function As A Coactivator Linking Gene-Specific Activators To The Basal Pol Ii Initiation Machinery. In Support Of This Model, We Provide Evidence That Mediator Serves In Vivo As A Coactivator For The Yeast Activator Met4, Which Controls The Gene Network Responsible For The Biosynthesis Of Sulfur-Containing Amino Acids And S-Adenosylmethionine. In Addition, We Show That Saga (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) Is Also Recruited To Met4 Target Promoters, Where It Participates In The Recruitment Of Pol Ii By A Mechanism Involving Histone Acetylation. Interestingly, We Find That Saga Is Not Required For Mediator Recruitment By Met4 And Vice Versa. Our Results Provide A Novel Example Of Functional Interplay Between Mediator And Coactivators Involved In Histone Modification.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone post-translational modifications regulate transcription and silent chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Regulation Of Chromatin Structure Is Important For The Control Of Dna-Templated Processes Such As Gene Expression And Silencing, And Its Dysregulation Is Implicated In Diverse Developmental And Cell Proliferative Defects Such As Tumorigenesis. Covalent Post-Translational Modifications Of Histones Are One Of The Prominent Means To Regulate The Chromatin Structure. Here, We Summarize Findings From Our Lab And Others Regarding The Interactions Between Different Covalent Modifications Of Histones In The Budding Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. First, We Describe The Effect Of Histone H3 Phosphorylation At Residue Serine 10 In Transcriptional Gene Activation, And Its Histone H3 Acetylation Dependent And Independent Modes Of Action And Downstream Effects On Tata-Binding Protein (Tbp) Recruitment. Further, We Review How Ubiquitylation Of Histone H2B And Its Deubiquitylation By Ubiquitin Proteases Ubp8 And Ubp10 Regulate Histone H3 Methylations, And Consequently Affect Co-Activator-Dependent Gene Transcription And Silent Chromatin, Respectively.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Eaf3 chromodomain interaction with methylated H3-K36 links histone deacetylation to Pol II elongation. Eaf3, A Component Of The Nua4 Histone Acetylase And Rpd3 Histone Deacetylase Complexes, Is Important For The Global Pattern Of Histone Acetylation In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Preferential Deacetylation Of Coding Regions Requires The Eaf3 Chromodomain And H3-K36 Methylation By Set2. The Eaf3 Chromodomain Interacts With Methylated H3-K36 Peptides, Suggesting That This Interaction Leads To Preferential Association And Histone Deacetylation Of The 3' Portions Of Coding Regions By The Rpd3 Complex. However, The Eaf3 Chromodomain And H3-K36 Methylation Do Not Significantly Affect Acetylation At Promoters, Suggesting That Eaf3 Has A Distinct Function, Presumably In The Nua4 Complex. Lastly, Eaf3 Inhibits Internal Initiation Within Mrna Coding Regions In A Manner Similar To Fact And Spt6. Our Results Link The Pattern Of Preferential Deacetylation At Coding Regions To The Underlying Patterns Of H3-K36 Methylation And Phosphorylation Of The Rna Polymerase Ii C-Terminal Domain, And Ultimately To The Mechanism By Which Repressive Chromatin Structure Is Restored After Transcriptional Elongation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Eukaryotic Genomes, Histone Acetylation And Thereafter Departure From The Chromatin Are Essential For Gene Transcription Initiation. Because Gene Transcription Is Tightly Regulated By Transcription Factors, There Are Some Speculations On The Cooperation Of Histone Acetylation And Transcription Factor Binding. However, Systematic Statistical Analyses Of This Relationship On A Genomic Scale Have Not Been Reported.We Apply Several Statistical Methods To Explore This Relationship On Two Recent Genomic Datasets: Acetylation Levels On 11 Histone Lysines And Binding Activities Of 203 Transcription Factors, Both In Promoter Regions Across The Yeast Genome. By Canonical Correlation Analysis, We Find That A Histone Acetylation Pattern Is Correlated With A Certain Profile Of Transcription Factor Binding In The Genome. Furthermore, After Clustering The Genes By Their Acetylation Levels On The 11 Histone Lysines, The Genes Within Clusters Show Distinct Transcription Factor Binding Profiles, As Discovered By Principle Component Analysis. Even After Applying Fairly Stringent Statistical Measurement, Most Of These Clusters Have Transcription Factors With Binding Activities Significantly Deviated From The Overall Genome. We Conclude That In The Yeast Genome, There Is A Strong Correlation Between Histone Acetylation And Transcription Factor Binding In The Promoter Regions.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Protein kinase CK2 in gene control at cell cycle entry. Protein Kinase Ck2 Has Diverse Links To Gene Control And Cell Cycle. Comparative Genome-Wide Expression Profiling Of Ck2 Mutants Of The Budding Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae At Cell Cycle Entry Has Revealed That A Significant Proportion Of Cell-Cycle Genes Are Affected By Ck2. Here, We Examine How Ck2 Realizes This Effect. We Show That The Ck2 Action May Be Directed To Gene Promoters Causing Genes With Promoter Homologies To Respond Comparably To Ck2 Perturbation. Examples Are Metabolic Pathway And Nutrition Supply Genes Such As The Pho And Met Regulon Genes, Responsible For Phosphate Maintenance And Methionine Biosynthesis, Respectively. Ck2 Perturbation Affects Both Regulons Permanently And Both Via Repression Of A Central Transcription Factor, But With Different Mechanisms: In The Pho Regulon, The Gene Encoding The Central Transcription Factor Pho4 Is Repressed And, In Addition, Pho4 And/Or The Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Of The Regulon'S Control Complex May Be Affected By Ck2 Phosphorylation. In The Met Regulon, The Repression Of The Central Transcription Factor Met4 Occurs Not By Expression Inhibition, But Rather By Availability Tuning Via A Ck2-Mediated Phosphorylation Of A Degradation Complex. On The Other Hand, The Ck2 Action May Be Directed To The Chromatin Regulon, Thus Affecting Globally The Expression Of Genes, I.E., The Ck2 Perturbation Results Either In Comparable Responses Of Genes Which Have No Promoter Homologies Or In Deviating Responses Despite Promoter Homologies. The Effect Is Rather Transient And Concerns Aside Various Cell Cycle Control Genes A Notable Number Of Genes Encoding Chromatin Remodeling And Modification Proteins With Functions In Chromatin Assembly And (Anti-)Silencing As Well As In Histone (De-)Acetylation, And Frequently Are Also Substrates Of Ck2, Suggesting Additional Tuning At Protein Level. In Line With These Findings, We Observe In Human Cells Sequence-Independent But Cell-Cycle-Dependent Ck2 Associations With Promoters Of Cell-Cycle-Regulated Genes At Periods Of Extensive Gene Expression Alterations, Including Cell Cycle Entry. Our Observations Are Compatible With The Idea That The Gene Control By Ck2 Is Achieved Via Different Mechanisms And At Different Levels Of Organization And Includes A Global Role In Transcription-Related Chromatin Remodelling And Modification.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Stable incorporation of sequence specific repressors Ash1 and Ume6 into the Rpd3L complex. Histone Deacetylation By Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Rpd3 Represses Genes Regulated By The Ash1 And Ume6 Dna-Binding Proteins. Rpd3 Exists In A Small 0.6 Mda (Rpd3S) And Large 1.2 Mda (Rpd3L) Corepressor Complex. In This Report, We Identify By Mass Spectrometry And Mudpit The Subunits Of The Rpd3L Complex. These Included Rpd3, Sds3, Pho23, Dep1, Rxt2, Sin3, Ash1, Ume1, Sap30, Cti6, Rxt3 And Ume6. Dep1 And Sds3, Unique Components Of Rpd3L, Were Required For Rpd3L Integrity And Hdac Activity. Similar To Rpd3, Deletion Of Dep1 Enhanced Telomeric Silencing And Derepressed Ino1. Two Sequence-Specific Repressors, Ash1 And Ume6, Were Stably Associated With Rpd3L. While Both Of These Proteins Localized To The Ino1 And Ho Promoters, The Repression Of These Genes Were Dependent Only On Ume6 And Ash1, Respectively. Thus, The Rpd3L Complex Is Directly Recruited To Specific Promoters Through Multiple Integral Dna-Binding Proteins.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cotranscriptional set2 methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 recruits a repressive Rpd3 complex. The Yeast Histone Deacetylase Rpd3 Can Be Recruited To Promoters To Repress Transcription Initiation. Biochemical, Genetic, And Gene-Expression Analyses Show That Rpd3 Exists In Two Distinct Complexes. The Smaller Complex, Rpd3C(S), Shares Sin3 And Ume1 With Rpd3C(L) But Contains The Unique Subunits Rco1 And Eaf3. Rpd3C(S) Mutants Exhibit Phenotypes Remarkably Similar To Those Of Set2, A Histone Methyltransferase Associated With Elongating Rna Polymerase Ii. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation And Biochemical Experiments Indicate That The Chromodomain Of Eaf3 Recruits Rpd3C(S) To Nucleosomes Methylated By Set2 On Histone H3 Lysine 36, Leading To Deacetylation Of Transcribed Regions. This Pathway Apparently Acts To Negatively Regulate Transcription Because Deleting The Genes For Set2 Or Rpd3C(S) Bypasses The Requirement For The Positive Elongation Factor Bur1/Bur2.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H3 methylation by Set2 directs deacetylation of coding regions by Rpd3S to suppress spurious intragenic transcription. Yeast Rpd3 Histone Deacetylase Plays An Important Role At Actively Transcribed Genes. We Characterized Two Distinct Rpd3 Complexes, Rpd3L And Rpd3S, By Mudpit Analysis. Both Complexes Shared A Three Subunit Core And Rpd3L Contains Unique Subunits Consistent With Being A Promoter Targeted Corepressor. Rco1 And Eaf3 Were Subunits Specific To Rpd3S. Mutants Of Rco1 And Eaf3 Exhibited Increased Acetylation In The Flo8 And Ste11 Open Reading Frames (Orfs) And The Appearance Of Aberrant Transcripts Initiating Within The Body Of These Orfs. Mutants In The Rna Polymerase Ii-Associated Set2 Histone Methyltransferase Also Displayed These Defects. Set2 Functioned Upstream Of Rpd3S And The Eaf3 Methyl-Histone Binding Chromodomain Was Important For Recruitment Of Rpd3S And For Deacetylation Within The Ste11 Orf. These Data Indicate That Pol Ii-Associated Set2 Methylates H3 Providing A Transcriptional Memory Which Signals For Deacetylation Of Orfs By Rpd3S. This Erases Transcription Elongation-Associated Acetylation To Suppress Intragenic Transcription Initiation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone variant H2A.Z marks the 5' ends of both active and inactive genes in euchromatin. In S. Cerevisiae, Histone Variant H2A.Z Is Deposited In Euchromatin At The Flanks Of Silent Heterochromatin To Prevent Its Ectopic Spread. We Show That H2A.Z Nucleosomes Are Found At Promoter Regions Of Nearly All Genes In Euchromatin. They Generally Occur As Two Positioned Nucleosomes That Flank A Nucleosome-Free Region (Nfr) That Contains The Transcription Start Site. Astonishingly, Enrichment At 5' Ends Is Observed Not Only At Actively Transcribed Genes But Also At Inactive Loci. Mutagenesis Of A Typical Promoter Revealed A 22 Bp Segment Of Dna Sufficient To Program Formation Of A Nfr Flanked By Two H2A.Z Nucleosomes. This Segment Contains A Binding Site Of The Myb-Related Protein Reb1 And An Adjacent Dt:Da Tract. Efficient Deposition Of H2A.Z Is Further Promoted By A Specific Pattern Of Histone H3 And H4 Tail Acetylation And The Bromodomain Protein Bdf1, A Component Of The Swr1 Remodeling Complex That Deposits H2A.Z.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide dynamics of Htz1, a histone H2A variant that poises repressed/basal promoters for activation through histone loss. Histone Variants Help Specialize Chromatin Regions; However, Their Impact On Transcriptional Regulation Is Largely Unknown. Here, We Determined The Genome-Wide Localization And Dynamics Of Htz1, The Yeast Histone H2A Variant. Htz1 Localizes To Hundreds Of Repressed/Basal Pol Ii Promoters And Prefers Tata-Less Promoters. Specific Htz1 Deposition Requires The Swr1 Complex, Which Largely Colocalizes With Htz1. Htz1 Occupancy Correlates With Particular Histone Modifications, And Htz1 Deposition Is Partially Reliant On Gcn5 (A Histone Acetyltransferase) And Bdf1, An Swr1 Complex Member That Binds Acetylated Histones. Changes In Growth Conditions Cause A Striking Redistribution Of Htz1 From Activated To Repressed/Basal Promoters. Furthermore, Htz1 Promotes Full Gene Activation But Does Not Generally Impact Repression. Importantly, Htz1 Releases From Purified Chromatin In Vitro Under Conditions Where H2A And H3 Remain Associated. We Suggest That Htz1-Bearing Nucleosomes Are Deposited At Repressed/Basal Promoters But Facilitate Activation Through Their Susceptibility To Loss, Thereby Helping To Expose Promoter Dna.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Regulation of NuA4 histone acetyltransferase activity in transcription and DNA repair by phosphorylation of histone H4. The Nua4 Complex Is A Histone H4/H2A Acetyltransferase Involved In Transcription And Dna Repair. While Histone Acetylation Is Important In Many Processes, It Has Become Increasingly Clear That Additional Histone Modifications Also Play A Crucial Interrelated Role. To Understand How Nua4 Action Is Regulated, We Tested Various H4 Tail Peptides Harboring Known Modifications In Hat Assays. While Dimethylation At Arginine 3 (R3M) Had Little Effect On Nua4 Activity, Phosphorylation Of Serine 1 (S1P) Strongly Decreased The Ability Of The Complex To Acetylate H4 Peptides. However, R3M In Combination With S1P Alleviates The Repression Of Nua4 Activity. Chromatin From Cells Treated With Dna Damage-Inducing Agents Shows An Increase In Phosphorylation Of Serine 1 And A Concomitant Decrease In H4 Acetylation. We Found That Casein Kinase 2 Phosphorylates Histone H4 And Associates With The Rpd3 Deacetylase Complex, Demonstrating A Physical Connection Between Phosphorylation Of Serine 1 And Unacetylated H4 Tails. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Experiments Also Link Local Phosphorylation Of H4 With Its Deacetylation, During Both Transcription And Dna Repair. Time Course Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Data Support A Model In Which Histone H4 Phosphorylation Occurs After Nua4 Action During Double-Strand Break Repair At The Step Of Chromatin Restoration And Deacetylation. These Findings Demonstrate That H4 Phospho-Serine 1 Regulates Chromatin Acetylation By The Nua4 Complex And That This Process Is Important For Normal Gene Expression And Dna Repair.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide map of nucleosome acetylation and methylation in yeast. Eukaryotic Genomes Are Packaged Into Nucleosomes Whose Position And Chemical Modification State Can Profoundly Influence Regulation Of Gene Expression. We Profiled Nucleosome Modifications Across The Yeast Genome Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Coupled With Dna Microarrays To Produce High-Resolution Genome-Wide Maps Of Histone Acetylation And Methylation. These Maps Take Into Account Changes In Nucleosome Occupancy At Actively Transcribed Genes And, In Doing So, Revise Previous Assessments Of The Modifications Associated With Gene Expression. Both Acetylation And Methylation Of Histones Are Associated With Transcriptional Activity, But The Former Occurs Predominantly At The Beginning Of Genes, Whereas The Latter Can Occur Throughout Transcribed Regions. Most Notably, Specific Methylation Events Are Associated With The Beginning, Middle, And End Of Actively Transcribed Genes. These Maps Provide The Foundation For Further Understanding The Roles Of Chromatin In Gene Expression And Genome Maintenance.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A new map for navigating the yeast epigenome. The Posttranslational Modification Of Histones By Acetylation Or Methylation Regulates Chromatin Structure And Can Determine How A Dna Sequence Is Interpreted By, For Example, The Transcriptional Machinery. In This Issue Of Cell, Pokholok And Colleagues (2005) Describe A New And Reliable Genome-Wide Microarray Study Of Histone Modifications And Gene Expression In Yeast. Their Epigenetic Map Can Be Used To Guide Further Research On The Epigenome.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Control of gene expression and assembly of chromosomal subdomains by chromatin regulators with antagonistic functions. Epigenetic Regulation Of Higher-Order Chromatin Structure Controls Gene Expression And The Assembly Of Chromosomal Domains During Cell Division, Differentiation, And Development. The Proposed "Histone Code" Integrates A Complex System Of Histone Modifications And Chromosomal Proteins That Establish And Maintain Distinctive Types Of Chromatin, Such As Euchromatin, Heterochromatin, And Centromeric (Cen) Chromatin. The Reversible Nature Of Histone Acetylation, Phosphorylation, And (Most Recently Discovered) Methylation Are Mechanisms For Controlling Gene Expression And Partitioning The Genome Into Functional Domains. Many Different Regions Of The Genome Contain Similar Epigenetic Marks (Histone Modifications), Raising The Question As To How They Are Independently Specified And Regulated. In This Review, We Will Focus On Several Recent Discoveries In Chromatin And Chromosome Biology: (1) Identification Of Long-Elusive Histone "De-Methylating" Enzymes That Affect Chromatin Structure, And (2) Assembly And Maintenance Of Chromatin Domains, Specifically Heterochromatin And Euchromatin, Through A Dynamic Equilibrium Of Modifying Enzymes, Histone Modifications, And Histone Variants Identified Biochemically And Genetically.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Hyperacetylated chromatin domains: lessons from heterochromatin. A Small But Growing Number Of Loci That Exhibit Covalent Histone Modifications, Such As Hyperacetylation, Over Broad Regions Of 10 Kb Or More Have Been Characterized. These Hyperacetylated Domains Occur Exclusively At Loci Containing Highly Expressed, Tissue-Specific Genes, And The Available Evidence Suggests That They Are Involved In The Activation Of These Genes. Although To Date Little Is Known Concerning The Formation Or Function Of These Domains, Rather More Is Known Concerning Repressive, Heterochromatic Domains, And The Example Provided By Heterochromatin May Be Instructive In Considering Mechanisms Of Active Domain Formation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Promoter occupancy is a major determinant of chromatin remodeling enzyme requirements. Chromatin Creates Transcriptional Barriers That Are Overcome By Coactivator Activities Such As Histone Acetylation By Gcn5 And Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling By Swi/Snf. Factors Defining The Differential Coactivator Requirements In The Transactivation Of Various Promoters Remain Elusive. Induction Of The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Pho5 Promoter Does Not Require Gcn5 Or Swi/Snf Under Fully Inducing Conditions Of No Phosphate. We Show That Pho5 Activation Is Highly Dependent On Both Coactivators At Intermediate Phosphate Concentrations, Conditions That Reduce The Nuclear Concentration Of The Pho4 Transactivator And Severely Diminish Its Association With Pho5 In The Absence Of Gcn5 Or Swi/Snf. Conversely, Physiological Increases In Pho4 Nuclear Concentration And Binding At Pho5 Suppress The Need For Both Gcn5 And Swi/Snf, Suggesting That Coactivator Redundancy Is Established At High Pho4 Binding Site Occupancy. Consistent With This, We Demonstrate, Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, That Gcn5 And Swi/Snf Are Directly Recruited To Pho5 And Other Strongly Transcribed Promoters, Including Gal1-10, Rpl19B, Rps22B, Pyk1, And Eft2, Which Do Not Require Either Coactivator For Expression. These Results Show That Activator Concentration And Binding Site Occupancy Play Crucial Roles In Defining The Extent To Which Transcription Requires Individual Chromatin Remodeling Enzymes. In Addition, Gcn5 And Swi/Snf Associate With Many More Genomic Targets Than Previously Appreciated.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Maintenance of low histone ubiquitylation by Ubp10 correlates with telomere-proximal Sir2 association and gene silencing. Low Levels Of Histone Covalent Modifications Are Associated With Gene Silencing At Telomeres And Other Regions In The Yeast S. Cerevisiae. Although The Histone Deacetylase Sir2 Maintains Low Acetylation, Mechanisms Responsible For Low H2B Ubiquitylation And Low H3 Methylation Are Unknown. Here, We Show That The Ubiquitin Protease Ubp10 Targets H2B For Deubiquitylation, Helping To Localize Sir2 To The Telomere. Ubp10 Exhibits Reciprocal Sir2-Dependent Preferential Localization Proximal To Telomeres, Where Ubp10 Serves To Maintain Low H2B Lys123 Ubiquitylation In This Region And, Through Previously Characterized Crosstalk, Maintains Low H3 Lys4 And Lys79 Methylation In A Slightly Broader Region. Ubp10 Is Also Localized To The Rdna Locus, A Second Silenced Domain, Where It Similarly Maintains Low Histone Methylation. We Compare Ubp10 To Ubp8, The Saga-Associated H2B Deubiquitylase Involved In Gene Activation, And Show That Telomeric And Gene-Silencing Functions Are Specific To Ubp10. Our Results Suggest That These H2B-Deubiquitylating Enzymes Have Distinct Genomic Functions.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H3 phosphorylation can promote TBP recruitment through distinct promoter-specific mechanisms. Histone Phosphorylation Influences Transcription, Chromosome Condensation, Dna Repair And Apoptosis. Previously, We Showed That Histone H3 Ser10 Phosphorylation (Pser10) By The Yeast Snf1 Kinase Regulates Ino1 Gene Activation In Part Via Gcn5/Saga Complex-Mediated Lys14 Acetylation (Aclys14). How Such Chromatin Modification Patterns Develop Is Largely Unexplored. Here We Examine The Mechanisms Surrounding Pser10 At Ino1, And At Gal1, Which Herein Is Identified As A New Regulatory Target Of Snf1/Pser10. Snf1 Behaves As A Classic Coactivator In Its Recruitment By Dna-Bound Activators, And In Its Role In Modifying Histones And Recruiting Tata-Binding Protein (Tbp). However, One Important Difference In Snf1 Function In Vivo At These Promoters Is That Saga Recruitment At Ino1 Requires Histone Phosphorylation Via Snf1, Whereas At Gal1, Saga Recruitment Is Independent Of Histone Phosphorylation. In Addition, The Gal1 Activator Physically Interacts With Both Snf1 And Saga, Whereas The Ino1 Activator Interacts Only With Snf1. Thus, At Ino1, Pser10'S Role In Recruiting Saga May Substitute For Recruitment By Dna-Bound Activator. Our Results Emphasize That Histone Modifications Share General Functions Between Promoters, But Also Acquire Distinct Roles Tailored For Promoter-Specific Requirements.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Partial depletion of histone H4 increases homologous recombination-mediated genetic instability. Dna Replication Can Be A Source Of Genetic Instability. Given The Tight Connection Between Dna Replication And Nucleosome Assembly, We Analyzed The Effect Of A Partial Depletion Of Histone H4 On Genetic Instability Mediated By Homologous Recombination. A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Strain Was Constructed In Which The Expression Of Histone H4 Was Driven By The Regulated Tet Promoter. In Agreement With Defective Nucleosome Assembly, Partial Depletion Of Histone H4 Led To Subtle Changes In Plasmid Superhelical Density And Chromatin Sensitivity To Micrococcal Nuclease. Under These Conditions, Homologous Recombination Between Ectopic Dna Sequences Was Increased 20-Fold Above The Wild-Type Levels. This Hyperrecombination Was Not Associated With Either Defective Repair Or Transcription But With An Accumulation Of Recombinogenic Dna Lesions During The S And G(2)/M Phases, As Determined By An Increase In The Proportion Of Budded Cells Containing Rad52-Yellow Fluorescent Protein Foci. Consistently, Partial Depletion Of Histone H4 Caused A Delay During The S And G(2)/M Phases. Our Results Suggest That Histone Deposition Defects Lead To The Formation Of Recombinogenic Dna Structures During Replication That Increase Genomic Instability.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The histone acetyltransferase GCN5 modulates the retrograde response and genome stability determining yeast longevity. Transcriptional Silencing Decreases At Both Subtelomeric And Silent Mating-Type Loci And Increases At The Ribosomal Dna Locus During The Replicative Life Span Of The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae . Evidence Exists That Epigenetic Changes In The Regulatory State Of Chromatin May Be A Causal Factor In Determining Yeast Longevity And That Histone Deacetylases Play A Role. The Significance Of Histone Acetylation Has Been Examined Here In More Detail. Deletion Of The Histone Acetyltransferase Gene Gcn5 Suppressed The Extension Of Replicative Life Span Afforded By The Induction Of The Retrograde Response, Which Signals Mitochondrial Dysfunction And Leads To Changes In Nuclear Gene Expression. It Was Difficult To Ascribe This Effect To Changes In Transcriptional Silencing In Any Of The Three Known Types Of Heterochromatin. However, A Promoter Related Effect Was Uncovered By The Participation Of Gcn5 In The Induction Of The Retrograde Response. Gcn5P And The Retrograde Signal Transducer Rtg2P Are Components Of The Histone Acetyltransferase Coactivator Complex Slik. Rtg2P Blocks The Production Of Extrachromosomal Ribosomal Dna Circles When It Is Not Engaged In Transmission Of The Retrograde Signal. Deletion Of Gcn5 , Which Disrupts The Integrity Of Slik, Suppressed Circle Accumulation. The Results Indicate That Gcn5P And Slik Impact The Interplay Between The Retrograde Response Signal And Rtg2P With Consequences For The Induction Of The Response And Circle Production. Rtg2P And Gcn5P In The Slik Complex Link Metabolism To Stress Responses, Chromatin-Dependent Gene Regulation, And Genome Stability In Yeast Aging.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H2A and Spt10 cooperate to regulate induction and autoregulation of the CUP1 metallothionein. Copper Is An Essential Cellular Cofactor That Becomes Toxic At High Levels. Copper Homeostasis Is Tightly Regulated By Opposing Mechanisms That Control Copper Import, Export, And Copper Binding Capacity Within The Cell. High Levels Of Copper Induce The Expression Of Metallothioneins, Small Sulfhydryl-Rich Proteins With High Metal Binding Capabilities That Serve As Neutralizers Of Toxic Levels Of Metals. In Yeast, The Cup1 Gene Encodes A Copper Metallothionein That Is Strongly Induced In Response To Metals And Other Stress And Is Subsequently Rapidly Down-Regulated. Activation Of Cup1 Is Mediated By The Copper-Responsive Transcriptional Activator Acei, And Also Requires The Histone Acetylase Spt10 For Full Induction. We Have Examined The Role Of Histone H2A In The Normal Regulation Of The Cup1 Gene. We Have Shown That Specific H2A Mutations In Combination With Spt10 Deletions Result In Aberrant Regulation Of Cup1 Expression. Certain Lysine Mutations In H2A Alleviate The Transcriptional Defect In Spt10 Delta Strains, Though Cup1 Activation Is Still Delayed In These Mutants; However, Cup1 Shutdown Is Normal. In Contrast, Serine Mutations In H2A Prevent Cup1 Shutdown When Combined With Spt10 Deletions. In Addition, Swi/Snf Mutants Exhibit Both Impaired Cup1 Induction And Failure To Shut Down Cup1 Normally. Finally, Different Spt10-Dependent Histone Acetylation Events Correlate With Induction And Shutdown. Taken Together, These Data Indicate That Cup1 Transcriptional Shutdown, Like Induction, Is An Active Process Controlled By The Chromatin Structure Of The Gene. These Results Provide New Insights For The Role Of Chromatin Structure In Metal Homeostasis.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	BAF53/Arp4 homolog Alp5 in fission yeast is required for histone H4 acetylation, kinetochore-spindle attachment, and gene silencing at centromere. Nuclear Actin-Related Proteins Play Vital Roles In Transcriptional Regulation; However, Their Biological Roles Remain Elusive. Here, We Characterize Alp5, Fission Yeast Homolog Of Arp4/Baf53. The Temperature-Sensitive Mutant Alp5-1134 Contains A Single Amino Acid Substitution In The Conserved C-Terminal Domain (S402N) And Displays Mitotic Phenotypes, Including Chromosome Condensation And Missegregation. Alp5 Forms A Complex With Mst1-Hat (Histone Acetyltransferase). Consistently, Inhibition Of Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs), By Either Addition Of A Specific Inhibitor Or A Mutation In Hdac-Encoding Clr6+ Gene, Rescues Alp5-1134. Immunoblotting With Specific Antibodies Against Acetylated Histones Shows That Alp5 Is Required For Histone H4 Acetylation At Lysines 5, 8, And 12, But Not Histone H3 Lysines 9 Or 14, And Furthermore Clr6 Plays An Opposing Role. Mitotic Arrest Is Ascribable To Activation Of The Mad2/Bub1 Spindle Checkpoint, In Which Both Proteins Localize To The Mitotic Kinetochores In Alp5-1134. Intriguingly, Alp5-1134 Displays Transcriptional Desilencing At The Core Centromere Without Altering The Overall Chromatin Structure, Which Also Is Suppressed By A Simultaneous Mutation In Clr6+. This Result Shows That Alp5 Is Essential For Histone H4 Acetylation, And Its Crucial Role Lies In The Establishment Of Bipolar Attachment Of The Kinetochore To The Spindle And Transcriptional Silencing At The Centromere.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Evidence for distinct mechanisms facilitating transcript elongation through chromatin in vivo. The Mechanism And Kinetics Of Rna Polymerase Ii Transcription And Histone Acetylation Were Studied By Chromatin Immunoprecipitation In Yeast. Our Results Indicate That A Significant Fraction Of Polymerases Starting Transcription Never Make It To The End Of A Long Gal-Vps13 Fusion Gene. Surprisingly, Induction Of Gal Genes Results In Substantial Loss Of Histone-Dna Contacts Not Only In The Promoter But Also In The Coding Region. The Loss Of Nucleosomes Is Dependent On Active Transcript Elongation, But Apparently Occurs Independently Of Histone Acetylation. In Contrast, Histones In Genes Previously Shown To Require The Histone Acetyltransferases Gcn5 And Elp3 For Normal Transcription Do Not Lose Dna Contacts, But Do Become Acetylated As A Result Of Transcription. Together, These Results Suggest The Existence Of At Least Two Distinct Mechanisms To Achieve Efficient Transcript Elongation Through Chromatin: A Pathway Based On Loss Of Histone-Dna Contacts, And A Histone Acetylation-Dependent Mechanism Correlating With Little Or No Net Loss Of Nucleosomes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The bromodomain-containing protein Bdf1p acts as a phenotypic and transcriptional multicopy suppressor of YAF9 deletion in yeast. It Was Observed Previously That The Deletion Of The Open Reading Frame Ynl107W (Yaf9) Was Highly Pleiotropic In Yeast And Caused Defective Growth Phenotypes In The Presence Of Several Unrelated Inhibitors, Including Caesium Chloride. We Have Selected Multicopy Extragenic Suppressor Genes, Revealing That This Phenotype Can Be Suppressed By Overdosing The Transcription Factors Bdf1 And Gat1 In The Yaf9Delta Strain. We Focused Our Analysis On Suppression By Bdf1 And Performed A Genome-Wide Transcript Analysis On A Yaf9Delta Strain, Compared With The Wild-Type And Bdf1-Suppressed Strains. Yaf9 Deletion Has A Clear Effect On Transcription And Leads To Modulation Of The Level Of Expression Of Several Genes. Transcription Of A Considerable Portion Of The Underexpressed Genes Is Restored To Wild-Type Levels In The Bdf1-Suppressed Strain. We Show By Chromatin Immunoprecipitation That Both Yaf9P And Bdf1P Bind To Promoters Of Some Of These Genes And That The Level Of H3 And H4 Acetylation At One Of These Promoters Is Significantly Lowered In The Yaf9 Deleted Strain, Compared With The Wild-Type And The Bdf1-Suppressed Strains.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Redundant mechanisms are used by Ssn6-Tup1 in repressing chromosomal gene transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Ssn6-Tup1 Corepressor Complex Regulates Many Genes In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Three Mechanisms Have Been Proposed To Explain Its Repression Functions: 1) Nucleosome Positioning By Binding Histone Tails; 2) Recruitment Of Histone Deacetylases; And 3) Direct Interference With The General Transcription Machinery Or Activators. It Is Unclear If Ssn6-Tup1 Utilizes Each Of These Mechanisms At A Single Gene In A Redundant Manner Or Each Individually At Different Loci. A Systematic Analysis Of The Contribution Of Each Mechanism At A Native Promoter Has Not Been Reported. Here We Employed A Genetic Strategy To Analyze The Contributions Of Nucleosome Positioning, Histone Deacetylation, And Mediator Interference In The Repression Of Chromosomal Tup1 Target Genes In Vivo. We Exploited The Fact That Ssn6-Tup1 Requires The Isw2 Chromatin Remodeling Complex To Establish Nucleosome Positioning In Vivo To Disrupt Chromatin Structure Without Affecting Other Tup1 Repression Functions. Deleting Isw2, The Histone Deacetylase Gene Hda1, Or Genes Encoding Mediator Subunits Individually Caused Slight Or No Derepression Of Rnr3 And Hug1. However, When Mediator Mutations Were Combined With Deltaisw2 Or Deltahda1 Mutations, Enhanced Transcription Was Observed, And The Strongest Level Of Derepression Was Observed In Triple Deltaisw2/Deltahda1/Mediator Mutants. The Increased Transcription In The Mutants Was Not Due To The Loss Of Tup1 At The Promoter And Correlated With Increased Tbp Cross-Linking To Promoters. Thus, Tup1 Utilizes Multiple Redundant Mechanisms To Repress Transcription Of Native Genes, Which May Be Important For It To Act As A Global Corepressor At A Wide Variety Of Promoters.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Precise nucleosome positioning and the TATA box dictate requirements for the histone H4 tail and the bromodomain factor Bdf1. Acetylation Of Histone Tails Plays A Key Role In Chromatin Dynamics And Is Associated With The Potential For Gene Expression. We Show Here That A 2-3 Bp Mispositioning Of The Nucleosome Covering The Tata Box At Pho5 Induces A Dependency On The Acetylatable Lysine Residues Of The Histone H4 N-Terminal Region And On The Tfiid-Associated Bromodomain Factor Bdf1. This Dependency Arises Either Through Fusion Of The Pho5 Promoter To A Lacz Reporter Or By Mutation Of The Tata Box In The Natural Gene. The Results Suggest That Promoters In Which The Tata Box Is Either Absent Or Poorly Accessible On The Surface Of A Nucleosome May Compensate By Using Bdf1 Bromodomains And Acetylated H4 Tails To Anchor Tfiid To The Promoter During The Initial Stages Of Transcription Activation. We Propose That Nucleosome Positioning At The Nucleotide Level Provides A Subtle, But Highly Effective, Mechanism For Gene Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Mapping global histone acetylation patterns to gene expression. Histone Acetyltransferases And Deacetylases With Specificities For Different Sites Of Acetylation Affect Common Chromatin Regions. This Could Generate Unique Patterns Of Acetylation That May Specify Downstream Biological Processes. To Search For Existence Of These Patterns And Their Relationship To Gene Activity, We Analyzed The Genome-Wide Acetylation Profiles For Eleven Lysines In The Four Core Histones Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We Find That Both Hyper- And Hypoacetylation Of Individual Lysines Are Associated With Transcription, Generating Distinct Patterns Of Acetylation That Define Groups Of Biologically Related Genes. The Genes Within These Groups Are Significantly Coexpressed, Mediate Similar Physiological Processes, Share Unique Cis-Regulatory Dna Motifs, And Are Enriched For Binding Of Specific Transcription Factors. Our Data Also Indicate That The In Vivo Binding Of The Transcription Factor Bdf1 Is Associated With Acetylation On Most Lysines But Relative Deacetylation On H4 Lysine 16. Thus, Certain Acetylation Patterns May Be Used As Surfaces For Specific Protein-Histone Interactions, Providing One Mechanism For Coordinate Regulation Of Chromatin Processes That Are Biologically Related.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	H2B ubiquitylation and de-ubiquitylation in gene activation. Previous Models For The Role Of Histone Modifications Suggest That Adding And Removing Modifications, Such As Acetylation/Deacetylation In Gene Regulation, Are Functionally Antagonistic. We Have Investigated A Transcriptional Role Of H2B C-Terminal Ubiquitylation And De-Ubiquitylation In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. H2B Ubiquitylation Is Required For Optimal Transcription Of Suc2 And Gal1 Genes. The Ubiquitin Hydrolase Ubp8 Is A Stable Component Of Saga But Not Ada Complexes, And Is Not Required For Overall Integrity Of Saga. Biochemical And Genetic Evidence Indicates That Ubp8 Targets H2B For Deubiquitylation. The Dynamic Balance Of H2B Ubiquitylation/Deubiquitylation Is Important For Gal1 Transcription Since Either Substitution Of The Ubiquitylation Site In H2B (Lys123), Or Loss Of Ubp8, Lowers Gal1 Expression. Further, This Balance Of Ubiquitylation Appears To Set The Balance Of Histone H3 Methylation At Lys4 Relative To Lys36. Thus, Unlike Acetylation/Deacetylation Whose Functions Are Mutually Opposing, Both Ubiquitylation And De-Ubiquitylation Are Required For Gene Activation. These Results Suggest That Ubiquitylation Of Histones Has A Unique Role Among Histone Modifications, Possibly To Orchestrate An Ordered Pathway Of Chromatin Alterations.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The activities of eukaryotic replication origins in chromatin. Dna Replication Initiates At Chromosomal Positions Called Replication Origins. This Review Will Focus On The Activity, Regulation And Roles Of Replication Origins In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. All Eukaryotic Cells, Including S. Cerevisiae, Depend On The Initiation (Activity) Of Hundreds Of Replication Origins During A Single Cell Cycle For The Duplication Of Their Genomes. However, Not All Origins Are Identical. For Example, There Is A Temporal Order To Origin Activation With Some Origins Firing Early During The S-Phase And Some Origins Firing Later. Recent Studies Provide Evidence That Posttranslational Chromatin Modifications, Heterochromatin-Binding Proteins And Nucleosome Positioning Can Control The Efficiency And/Or Timing Of Chromosomal Origin Activity In Yeast. Many More Origins Exist Than Are Necessary For Efficient Replication. The Availability Of Excess Replication Origins Leaves Individual Origins Free To Evolve Distinct Forms Of Regulation And/Or Roles In Chromosomes Beyond Their Fundamental Role In Dna Synthesis. We Propose That Some Origins Have Acquired Roles In Controlling Chromatin Structure And/Or Gene Expression. These Roles Are Not Linked Obligatorily To Replication Origin Activity Per Se, But Instead Exploit Multi-Subunit Replication Proteins With The Potential To Form Context-Dependent Protein-Protein Interactions.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Tandem bromodomains in the chromatin remodeler RSC recognize acetylated histone H3 Lys14. The Coordination Of Chromatin Remodeling With Chromatin Modification Is A Central Topic In Gene Regulation. The Yeast Chromatin Remodeling Complex Rsc Bears Multiple Bromodomains, Motifs For Acetyl-Lysine And Histone Tail Interaction. Here, We Identify And Characterize Rsc4 And Show That It Bears Tandem Essential Bromodomains. Conditional Rsc4 Bromodomain Mutations Were Isolated, And Were Lethal In Combination With Gcn5Delta, Whereas Combinations With Esa1 Grew Well. Replacements Involving Lys14 Of Histone H3 (The Main Target Of Gcn5), But Not Other H3 Or H4 Lysine Residues, Also Conferred Severe Growth Defects To Rsc4 Mutant Strains. Importantly, Wild-Type Rsc4 Bound An H3 Tail Peptide Acetylated At Lys14, Whereas A Bromodomain Mutant Derivative Did Not. Loss Of Particular Histone Deacetylases Suppressed Rsc4 Bromodomain Mutations, Suggesting That Rsc4 Promotes Gene Activation. Furthermore, Rsc4 Mutants Displayed Defects In The Activation Of Genes Involved In Nicotinic Acid Biosynthesis, Cell Wall Integrity, And Other Pathways. Taken Together, Rsc4 Bears Essential Tandem Bromodomains That Rely On H3 Lys14 Acetylation To Assist Rsc Complex For Gene Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Barrier proteins remodel and modify chromatin to restrict silenced domains. Transcriptionally Active And Inactive Domains Are Frequently Found Adjacent To One Another In The Eukaryotic Nucleus. To Better Understand The Underlying Mechanisms By Which Domains Maintain Opposing Transcription Patterns, We Performed A Systematic Genomewide Screen For Proteins That May Block The Spread Of Silencing In Yeast. This Analysis Identified Numerous Proteins With Efficient Silencing Blocking Activities, And Some Of These Have Previously Been Shown To Be Involved In Chromatin Dynamics. We Isolated Subunits Of Swi/Snf, Mediator, And Tfiid, As Well As Subunits Of The Sas-I, Saga, Nua3, Nua4, Spt10P, Rad6P, And Dot1P Complexes, As Barrier Proteins. We Demonstrate That Histone Acetylation And Chromatin Remodeling Occurred At The Barrier And Correlated With A Block To The Spread Of Silencing. Our Data Suggest That Multiple Overlapping Mechanisms Were Involved In Delimiting Silenced And Active Domains In Vivo.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Rad6 plays a role in transcriptional activation through ubiquitylation of histone H2B. Covalent Modifications Of The Histone N Tails Play Important Roles In Eukaryotic Gene Expression. Histone Acetylation, In Particular, Is Required For The Activation Of A Subset Of Eukaryotic Genes Through The Targeted Recruitment Of Histone Acetyltransferases. We Have Reported That A Histone C Tail Modification, Ubiquitylation Of H2B, Is Required For Optimal Expression Of Several Inducible Yeast Genes, Consistent With A Role In Transcriptional Activation. H2B Was Shown To Be Ubiquitylated And Then Deubiquitylated At The Gal1 Core Promoter Following Galactose Induction. We Now Show That The Rad6 Protein, Which Catalyzes Monoubiquitylation Of H2B, Is Transiently Associated With The Gal1 Promoter Upon Gene Activation, And That The Period Of Its Association Temporally Overlaps With The Period Of H2B Ubiquitylation. Rad6 Promoter Association Depends On The Gal4 Activator And The Rad6-Associated E3 Ligase, Bre1, But Is Independent Of The Histone Acetyltransferase, Gcn5. The Saga Complex, Which Contains A Ubiquitin Protease That Targets H2B For Deubiquitylation, Is Recruited To The Gal1 Promoter In The Absence Of H2B Ubiquitylation. The Data Suggest That Rad6 And Saga Function Independently During Galactose Induction, And That The Staged Recruitment Of These Two Factors To The Gal1 Promoter Regulates The Ubiquitylation And Deubiquitylation Of H2B. We Additionally Show That Both Rad6 And Ubiquitylated H2B Are Absent From Two Regions Of Transcriptionally Silent Chromatin But Present At Genes That Are Actively Transcribed. Thus, Like Histone H3 Lysine 4 And Lysine 79 Methylation, Two Modifications That It Regulates, Rad6-Directed H2B Ubiquitylation Defines Regions Of Active Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Post-TATA binding protein recruitment clearance of Gcn5-dependent histone acetylation within promoter nucleosomes. Transcriptional Activation Of Eukaryotic Genes Often Requires The Function Of Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats), Which Is Expected To Result In The Hyperacetylation Of Histones Within Promoter Nucleosomes. In This Study We Show That, In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, The Steady-State Levels Of Gcn5-Dependent Histone Acetylation Within A Number Of Transcriptionally Active Promoters Are Inversely Related To The Rate Of Transcription. High Acetylation Levels Were Measured Only When Transcription Was Attenuated Either By Tata Element Mutations Or In A Strain Carrying A Temperature-Sensitive Protein Component Of Rna Polymerase Ii. In Addition, We Show That In One Case The Low Levels Of Histone Acetylation Depend On The Function Of The Rpd3 Histone Deacetylase. These Results Point To The Existence Of An Unexpected Interplay Of Two Opposing Histone-Modifying Activities Which Operate On Promoter Nucleosomes Following The Initiation Of Rna Synthesis. Such Interplay Could Ensure Rapid Turnover Of Chromatin Acetylation States In Continuously Reprogrammed Transcriptional Systems.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Nucleosome position-dependent and -independent activation of HIS7 epression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by different transcriptional activators. Aro4 And His7 Are Two Tandemly Orientated Genes Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae That Are Transcribed Into The Same Direction. The Aro4 Terminator And The His7 Promoter Regions Are Sensitive To Micrococcus Nuclease (Mnase) And Separated By A Positioned Nucleosome. The His7 Promoter Is Target For The Transcription Factors Gcn4P And Bas1P/Bas2P That Activate Its Transcription Upon Amino Acid Starvation And Purine Limitation, Respectively. Activation Of The His7 Gene By Gcn4P Overexpression But Not By Bas1P/Bas2P Releases An Ordered Nucleosome Distribution To Yield Increased Mnase Sensitivity Throughout The Intergenic Region. This Remodeling Is Snf2 Dependent But Mostly Gcn5 Independent. Accordingly, Snf2 Is Necessary For The Gcn4P-Mediated Transcriptional Activation Of The His7 Gene. Gcn5 Is Required For Activation Upon Adenine Limitation By Bas1P/Bas2P. Our Data Suggest That Activation Of His7 Transcription By Gcn4P And Bas1P/Bas2P Is Supported By A Nucleosome Position-Dependent And -Independent Mechanism, Respectively. Whereas Gcn4P Activation Causes Swi/Snf-Mediated Remodeling Of The Nucleosomal Architecture At The His7 Promoter, The Bas1P/Bas2P Complex Presumably Activates In Combination With Gcn5P-Dependent Histone Acetylation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	mSin3-associated protein, mSds3, is essential for pericentric heterochromatin formation and chromosome segregation in mammalian cells. The Histone Code Guides Many Aspects Of Chromosome Biology Including The Equal Distribution Of Chromosomes During Cell Division. In The Chromatin Domains Surrounding The Centromere, Known As Pericentric Heterochromatin, Histone Modifications, Particularly Deacetylation And Methylation, Appear To Be Essential For Proper Chromosome Segregation. However, The Specific Factors And Their Precise Roles In This Highly Orchestrated Process Remain Under Active Investigation. Here, We Report That Germ-Line Or Somatic Deletion Of Msds3, An Essential Component Of The Functional Msin3/Hdac Corepressor Complex, Generates A Cell-Lethal Condition Associated With Rampant Aneuploidy, Defective Karyokinesis, And Consequently, A Failure Of Cytokinesis. Msds3-Deficient Cells Fail To Deacetylate And Methylate Pericentric Heterochromatin Histones And To Recruit Essential Heterochromatin-Associated Proteins, Resulting In Aberrant Associations Among Heterologous Chromosomes Via Centromeric Regions And Consequent Failure To Properly Segregate Chromosomes. Mutant Msds3 Molecules That Are Defective In Msin3 Binding Fail To Rescue The Msds3 Null Phenotypes. On The Basis Of These Findings, We Propose That Msds3 And Its Associated Msin3/Hdac Components Play A Central Role In Initiating The Cascade Of Pericentric Heterochromatin-Specific Modifications Necessary For The Proper Distribution Of Chromosomes During Cell Division In Mammalian Cells.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Yaf9, a novel NuA4 histone acetyltransferase subunit, is required for the cellular response to spindle stress in yeast. Yaf9 Is One Of Three Proteins In Budding Yeast Containing A Yeats Domain. We Show That Yaf9 Is Part Of A Large Complex And That It Coprecipitates With Three Known Subunits Of The Nua4 Histone Acetyltransferase. Although Esa1, The Catalytic Subunit Of Nua4, Is Essential For Viability, We Found That Yaf9 Delta Mutants Are Viable But Hypersensitive To Microtubule Depolymerizing Agents And Synthetically Lethal With Two Different Mutants Of The Mitotic Apparatus. Microtubules Depolymerized More Readily In The Yaf9Delta Mutant Compared To The Wild Type In The Presence Of Nocodazole, And Recovery Of Microtubule Polymerization And Cell Division From Limiting Concentrations Of Nocodazole Was Inhibited. Two Other Nua4 Mutants (Esa1-1851 And Yng2 Delta) And Nonacetylatable Histone H4 Mutants Were Also Sensitive To Benomyl. Furthermore, Wild-Type Budding Yeast Were More Resistant To Benomyl When Grown In The Presence Of Trichostatin A, A Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor. These Results Strongly Suggest That Acetylation Of Histone H4 By Nua4 Is Required For The Cellular Resistance To Spindle Stress.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by butyrate. This Article Reviews The Effects Of The Short-Chain Fatty Acid Butyrate On Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Activity. Sodium Butyrate Has Multiple Effects On Cultured Mammalian Cells That Include Inhibition Of Proliferation, Induction Of Differentiation And Induction Or Repression Of Gene Expression. The Observation That Butyrate Treatment Of Cells Results In Histone Hyperacetylation Initiated A Flurry Of Activity That Led To The Discovery That Butyrate Inhibits Hdac Activity. Butyrate Has Been An Essential Agent For Determining The Role Of Histone Acetylation In Chromatin Structure And Function. Interestingly, Inhibition Of Hdac Activity Affects The Expression Of Only 2% Of Mammalian Genes. Promoters Of Butyrate-Responsive Genes Have Butyrate Response Elements, And The Action Of Butyrate Is Often Mediated Through Sp1/Sp3 Binding Sites (E.G., P21(Waf1/Cip1)). We Demonstrated That Sp1 And Sp3 Recruit Hdac1 And Hdac2, With The Latter Being Phosphorylated By Protein Kinase Ck2. A Model Is Proposed In Which Inhibition Of Sp1/Sp3-Associated Hdac Activity Leads To Histone Hyperacetylation And Transcriptional Activation Of The P21(Waf1/Cip1) Gene; P21(Waf1/Cip1) Inhibits Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 Activity And Thereby Arrests Cell Cycling. Pending The Cell Background, The Nonproliferating Cells May Enter Differentiation Or Apoptotic Pathways. The Potential Of Butyrate And Hdac Inhibitors In The Prevention And Treatment Of Cancer Is Presented.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Inhibition of histone deacetylase activity increases chromosomal instability by the aberrant regulation of mitotic checkpoint activation. Histone Modification Through Acetylation And Deacetylation Is A Key Process In Transcription, Dna Replication, And Chromosome Segregation. During Mitosis, Histones Are Highly Acetylated And Chromatin Is Condensed. Here, We Investigate The Mechanistic Involvement Of Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Activity In The Regulation Of Mitotic Checkpoint Activation. Inhibition Of Hdac Activity Was Found To Cause The Improper Kinetochore Localization Of The Mitotic Checkpoint Proteins, And To Prolong Mitotic Arrest, And Thus To Lead To Chromosomal Instability Due To Aberrant Exit From The Mitotic Cell Cycle Arrest. In Addition, Treatment With Hdac Inhibitor Attenuated The Activations Of P38 And Erk Kinases, And Increased The Expression Levels Of Ciap-1, Suggesting That The Observed Increased Adaptation And Chromosomal Instability Induced By Inhibiting Hdac Activity Might Be Directly Connected With The Activations Of Cell Survival And/Or Antiapoptotic Signals. Moreover, The Treatment Of Cells With Mitotic Defects With Hdac Inhibitor Increased Their Susceptibility To Chromosomal Instability. These Results Support The Notion That Hdac Activity Plays An Important Role In The Regulation Of Mitotic Checkpoint Activation, And Thus The Aberrant Control Of Hdac Activity Contributes To Chromosomal Instability.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Shear stress-mediated chromatin remodeling provides molecular basis for flow-dependent regulation of gene expression. Shear Stress (Ss), The Tangential Component Of Hemodynamic Forces, Modulates The Expression Of Several Genes In Endothelial Cells. However, No Information Is Available About Its Effect On Chromatin Structure, Which Plays A Key Role In Gene Transcription. In This Study, A Link Between Ss And Chromatin Remodeling Was Established In Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (Huvecs). Huvecs Were Exposed To Ss Of 10 Dyne/Cm2 Per Second, In The Presence Or Absence Of The Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Trichostatin A, And Assayed For Histone H3 And Histone H4 Modifications. Ss Induced Histone H3 Serine Phosphorylation At Position 10 (S10) And Lysine Acetylation At Position 14 (K14) But Required Trichostatin A To Induce H3 Phosphoacetylation And H4 Acetylation. The Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Inhibitor Wortmannin And The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Inhibitor Pd98059 Decreased Ss-Dependent Histone H3 Phosphorylation, Without Affecting Its Acetylation; The P38 Inhibitor Sb203580 Reduced Both H3 Phosphorylation And Acetylation, Whereas The Protein Kinase A Inhibitor Pki-Tide Reduced Histone H3 Acetylation. Remarkably, The Abrogation Of Histone Acetylation Inhibited Ss-Dependent C-Fos Expression. Ss Also Activated Ribosomal S6 Kinase-2 And Mitogen- And Stress-Activated Kinase-1 Protein Kinases And Promoted The Formation Of A Camp-Responsive Element-Binding Protein (Creb)/Creb-Binding Protein Complex, Providing The Molecular Basis For The Increase In Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Observed In Huvecs Exposed To Ss. Finally, The Effect Of Ss On Chromatin Remodeling Was Examined. In Huvecs Exposed To Ss, Chromatin Within C-Fos And C-Jun Promoters Was Specifically Immunoprecipitated By An Antibody Against Acetylated Histone H3 On K14. These Results Indicate That Ss Induces Posttransduction Modifications Of Histones; This Is An Early Step Toward The Flow-Dependent Regulation Of Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The SV40 T antigen modulates CBP histone acetyltransferase activity. Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) Play A Key Role In Transcription Control, Cell Proliferation And Differentiation By Modulating Chromatin Structure; However, Little Is Known About Their Own Regulation. Here We Show That Expression Of The Viral Oncoprotein Sv40 T Antigen Increases Histone Acetylation And Global Cellular Hat Activities. In Addition, It Enhances Creb-Binding Protein Hat Activity And Modulates Its Transcriptional Activity. Finally, We Show That Inhibition Of Cellular Histone Deacetylases By Trichostatin A Increases The Sv40 Infectivity Rate. These Findings Highlight The Importance Of Histone Acetylation In The Regulation Of The Cell Cycle By Oncoviral Proteins.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Transcriptional regulation of meiosis in budding yeast. Initiation Of Meiosis In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Is Regulated By Mating Type And Nutritional Conditions That Restrict Meiosis To Diploid Cells Grown Under Starvation Conditions. Specifically, Meiosis Occurs In Mata/Matalpha Cells Shifted To Nitrogen Depletion Media In The Absence Of Glucose And The Presence Of A Nonfermentable Carbon Source. These Conditions Lead To The Expression And Activation Of Ime 1, The Master Regulator Of Meiosis. Ime1 Encodes A Transcriptional Activator Recruited To Promoters Of Early Meiosis-Specific Genes By Association With The Dna-Binding Protein, Ume6. Under Vegetative Growth Conditions These Genes Are Silent Due To Recruitment Of The Sin3/Rpd3 Histone Deacetylase And Isw2 Chromatin Remodeling Complexes By Ume6. Transcription Of These Meiotic Genes Occurs Following Histone Acetylation By Gcn5. Expression Of The Early Genes Promote Entry Into The Meiotic Cycle, As They Include Genes Required For Premeiotic Dna Synthesis, Synapsis Of Homologous Chromosomes, And Meiotic Recombination. Two Of The Early Meiosis Specific Genes, A Transcriptional Activator, Ndt80, And A Cdk2 Homologue, Ime2, Are Required For The Transcription Of Middle Meiosis-Specific Genes That Are Involved With Nuclear Division And Spore Formation. Spore Maturation Depends On Late Genes Whose Expression Is Indirectly Dependent On Ime1, Ime2, And Ndt80. Finally, Phosphorylation Of Imel By Ime2 Leads To Its Degradation, And Consequently To Shutting Down Of The Meiotic Transcriptional Cascade. This Review Is Focusing On The Regulation Of Gene Expression Governing Initiation And Progression Through Meiosis.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Communication between NF-kappa B and Sp1 controls histone acetylation within the proximal promoter of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 gene. The Induction Of The Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein 1 Gene (Mcp-1) By Tnf Occurs Through An Nf-Kappab-Dependent Distal Regulatory Region And An Sp1-Dependent Proximal Regulatory Region That Are Separated By 2.2 Kb Of Sequence. To Investigate How These Regions Coordinate Activation Of Mcp-1 In Response To Tnf, Experiments Were Performed To Examine The Role Of Coactivators, Changes In Local Chromatin Structure, And The Acetylation Of Histones At The Mcp-1 Regulatory Regions. An E1A-Sensitive Coactivator Was Found To Be Required For Expression. In Vivo Nuclease Sensitivity Assays Identified Changes In Response To Tnf At Both The Proximal And Distal Regions That Were Dependent On The P65 Subunit Of Nf-Kappab And Sp1. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations Used To Analyze Factor Assembly And Histone Acetylation At The Distal And Proximal Regions Showed That Sp1 Binding To And Histone Acetylation Of The Proximal Region Was Dependent On Nf-Kappab P65. Conversely, Sp1 Assembly At The Proximal Region Was Required For P65 Binding To And Acetylation Of The Distal Region, Suggesting Communication Between The Two Regions During Gene Activation. These Data And The Nf-Kappab P65-Dependent Histone Acetylation Of A Middle Region Sequence Suggest A Potential Order For The Assembly, Acetylation And Accessibility Of The Mcp-1 Regulatory Regions In Response To Tnf.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin remodeling and cancer. The Fate Of The Cell Relies On A Delicate Balance Between Gene Expression And Repression. The Transcriptional Control Of The Genome Is Maintained Not Only By Transcription Factors But Also Chromatin Remodeling Proteins. The Purpose Of The Chromatin Remodeling Proteins Is To Alter The Nucleosome Architecture Such That Genes Are Exposed To Or Hidden From The Transcriptional Machinery. The Nucleosome Can Be Restructured By Two Mechanisms: 1. The Movement Of Nucleosomes Along Dma Which Is Carried Out By Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Complexes; And 2. The Modification Of Core Histones By Histone Acetyltransferases, Deactylases, Methyltrans-Ferases, And Kinases. Since These Chromatin Remodeling Proteins Play An Essential Role In Transcriptional Regulation, It Is Not Surprising That They Have Been Linked To Cancer. In This Review, We Provide A General Overview On Chromatin Remodeling And Describe Known Genetic Alterations Of Chromatin Remodeling Proteins In Human Cancers. We Also Discuss Potential Other, As Yet Unexplored Strategies That Cancers Might Take To Manipulate The Chromatin Remodeling Machinery.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Collaborative spirit of histone deacetylases in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. The Flexible N-Terminal Tails Of Core Histones Are Subject To Dynamic, Reversible Lysine Acetylation. At Least 10 Histone Deacetylases Have Been Identified In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And 19 In Humans. Emerging Themes Regarding The Function And Regulation Of These Enzymes Include The Following: Targeted And Non-Targeted Chromatin Deacetylation; Their Collaboration With Each Other And With Other Chromatin Regulators To Promote Transcriptional Repression And Silencing; Deacetylation Of Transcription Factors And Other Non-Histone Proteins; And Regulation By Subcellular Compartmentalization And Subunit Association. Histone Deacetylases Are Important Targets For Drugs With Potential Therapeutic Value In The Treatment Of Cancer, Neurodegenerative Disorders, Cardiac Hypertrophy And Other Human Diseases.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	HIV Tat, its TARgets and the control of viral gene expression. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Hiv-1) (Transactivator Of Transcription (Tat)) Protein Is A Pleiotropic Factor That Induces A Broad Range Of Biological Effects In Numerous Cell Types. At The Hiv Promoter, Tat Is A Powerful Transactivator Of Gene Expression, Which Acts By Both Inducing Chromatin Remodeling And By Recruiting Elongation-Competent Transcriptional Complexes Onto The Viral Ltr. Besides These Transcriptional Activities, Tat Is Released Outside The Cells And Interacts With Different Cell Membrane-Associated Receptors. Finally, Extracellular Tat Can Be Internalized By Cells Through An Active Endocytosis Process. Here We Discuss Some Of The Molecular Mechanisms Involved In Intracellular And Extracellular Tat Function.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide expression screens indicate a global role for protein kinase CK2 in chromatin remodeling. Protein Kinase Ck2, A Vital, Pleiotropic And Highly Conserved Serine/Threonine Phosphotransferase Is Involved In Transcription-Directed Signaling, Gene Control And Cell Cycle Regulation And Is Suspected To Play A Role In Global Processes. Searching For These Global Roles, We Analyzed The Involvement Of Ck2 In Gene Expression At Cell Cycle Entry By Using Genome-Wide Screens. Comparing Expression Profiles Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Wild-Type Strains With Strains With Regulatory Or Catalytic Subunits Of Ck2 Deleted, We Found Significant Alterations In The Expression Of Genes At All Cell Cycle Phases And Often In A Subunit- And Isoform-Specific Manner. Roughly A Quarter Of The Genes Known To Be Regulated By The Cell Cycle Are Affected. Functionally, The Genes Are Involved With Cell Cycle Entry, Progression And Exit, Including Spindle Pole Body Formation And Dynamics. Strikingly, Most Ck2-Affected Genes Exhibit No Common Transcriptional Control Features, And A Considerable Proportion Of Temporarily Altered Genes Encodes Proteins Involved In Chromatin Remodeling And Modification, Including Chromatin Assembly, (Anti-)Silencing And Histone (De-)Acetylation. In Addition, Various Metabolic Pathway And Nutritional Supply Genes Are Affected. Our Data Are Compatible With The Idea That Ck2 Acts At Different Levels Of Cellular Organization And That Ck2 Has A Global Role In Transcription-Related Chromatin Remodeling.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cellular context of coregulator and adaptor proteins regulates human adenovirus 5 early region 1A-dependent gene activation by the thyroid hormone receptor. In Mammalian Cells, The Human Adenovirus Type 5 Early Region 1A (E1A) Oncoprotein Functions As A Thyroid Hormone (Th)-Dependent Activator Of The Thyroid Hormone Receptor (Tr). Interestingly, In The Cellular Context Of The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, E1A Acts As A Tr-Specific Constitutive Coactivator That Is Down-Regulated By Th. Th Reduces The Interaction Of E1A With The Tr In Yeast But Not Hela Cells. The N-Terminal 82 Amino Acids Of E1A Are Sufficient For Coactivation In Yeast And Residues 4-29 Are Essential. In Yeast, Expression Of The Nuclear Receptor Corepressor (N-Cor) Could Down-Regulate Constitutive Transcriptional Activation Of The Tr By E1A, Whereas Expression Of The Glucocorticoid Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (Grip-1) Coactivator Reconstituted The E1A-Induced Pattern Of Enhanced Th-Dependent Gene Activation By Tr Observed In Mammalian Cells. We Further Show That The Mating Type Switching Gene (Swi)/Sucrose Nonfermenting (Snf) Gene Chromatin Remodeling Complex Is Required For Both Th/Grip-1- And E1A-Dependent Coactivator Function, Whereas The General Control Nonrepressed Protein (Gcn5)/Alteration/Deficiency In Activation Protein (Ada2) Components Of The Spt, Ada, Gcn5, Acetylation (Saga) Transcriptional Adaptor Complex Are Required For Th/Grip-1, But Not E1A-Dependent Activation Of The Tr. Taken Together, These Studies Demonstrate That The Novel Tr-Specific Coactivator Function Of E1A In Yeast Depends On The Swi/Snf Chromatin Remodeling Complex And Can Be Further Influenced By Changes In The Cellular Complement Of Transcriptional Coregulatory Proteins.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Conserved histone variant H2A.Z protects euchromatin from the ectopic spread of silent heterochromatin. Boundary Elements Hinder The Spread Of Heterochromatin, Yet These Sites Do Not Fully Account For The Preservation Of Adjacent Euchromatin. Histone Variant H2A.Z (Htz1 In Yeast) Replaces Conventional H2A In Many Nucleosomes. Microarray Analysis Revealed That Htz1-Activated Genes Cluster Near Telomeres. The Reduced Expression Of Most Of These Genes In Htz1Delta Cells Was Reversed By The Deletion Of Sir2 (Sir2Delta) Suggesting That H2A.Z Antagonizes Telomeric Silencing. Other Htz1-Activated Genes Flank The Silent Hmr Mating-Type Locus. Their Requirement For Htz1 Can Be Bypassed By Sir2Delta Or By A Deletion Encompassing The Silencing Nucleation Sites In Hmr. In Htz1Delta Cells, Sir2 And Sir3 Spread Into Flanking Euchromatic Regions, Producing Changes In Histone H4 Acetylation And H3 4-Methylation Indicative Of Ectopic Heterochromatin Formation. Htz1 Is Enriched In These Euchromatic Regions And Acts Synergistically With A Boundary Element To Prevent The Spread Of Heterochromatin. Thus, Euchromatin And Heterochromatin Each Contains Components That Antagonize Switching To The Opposite Chromatin State.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate response element modulator suppresses IL-2 production in stimulated T cells by a chromatin-dependent mechanism. The Production Of Il-2 Is Tightly Controlled By Several Transcription Factors That Bind To The Il-2 Promoter. The Camp Response Element Modulator (Crem) Is Known To Form Complexes With Creb And Bind To The -180 Site Of The Il-2 Promoter In Anergic And In Systemic Lupus Erythematosus T Cells. In This Study We Show That Crem Is Transcriptionally Induced In T Cells Following Stimulation Through Cd3 And Cd28, Binds To The Il-2 Promoter In Vivo, And Suppresses Il-2 Production. Transfection Of An Antisense Crem Plasmid Into T Cells Blocked The Expression And Binding Of Crem To The Il-2 Promoter And The Decrease Of Il-2 Production, Which Follows The Early Increase After T Cell Stimulation With Cd3 And Cd28. In Addition, As Assessed By Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Experiments, Antisense Crem Prevented The Binding Of Protein 300 And Camp Response Element Binding Protein And Promoted The Acetylation Of Histones. Antisense Crem Also Enhanced The Accessibility Of The Il-2 Promoter To Endonucleases And Prevented The Condensation Of Chromatin In Vivo. Our Data Suggest That Upon T Cell Activation, Crem Gradually Replaces Phosphorylated Creb At The -180 Site Of The Il-2 Promoter. Crem, In Turn, Binds Protein 300 And Camp Response Element Binding Protein, But Crem Is Unable To Activate Its Histone Acetyltransferase Activity, Which Results In Condensation Of Chromatin And Down-Regulation Of Il-2 Production.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Regulation of TATA-binding protein binding by the SAGA complex and the Nhp6 high-mobility group protein. Transcriptional Activation Of The Yeast Ho Gene Involves The Sequential Action Of Dna-Binding And Chromatin-Modifying Factors. Here We Examine The Role Of The Saga Complex And The Nhp6 Architectural Transcription Factor In Ho Regulation. Our Data Suggest That These Factors Regulate Binding Of The Tata-Binding Protein (Tbp) To The Promoter. A Gcn5 Mutation, Eliminating The Histone Acetyltransferase Present In Saga, Reduces The Transcription Of Ho, But Expression Is Restored In A Gcn5 Spt3 Double Mutant. We Conclude That The Major Role Of Gcn5 In Ho Activation Is To Overcome Repression By Spt3. Spt3 Is Also Part Of Saga, And Thus Two Proteins In The Same Regulatory Complex Can Have Opposing Roles In Transcriptional Regulation. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Experiments Show That Tbp Binding To Ho Is Very Weak In Wild-Type Cells But Markedly Increased In An Spt3 Mutant, Indicating That Spt3 Reduces Ho Expression By Inhibiting Tbp Binding. In Contrast, It Has Been Shown Previously That Spt3 Stimulates Tbp Binding To The Gal1 Promoter As Well As Gal1 Expression, And Thus, Spt3 Regulates These Promoters Differently. We Also Find Genetic Interactions Between Tbp And Either Gcn5 Or The High-Mobility-Group Protein Nhp6, Including Multicopy Suppression And Synthetic Lethality. These Results Suggest That, While Spt3 Acts To Inhibit Tbp Interaction With The Ho Promoter, Gcn5 And Nhp6 Act To Promote Tbp Binding. The Result Of These Interactions Is To Limit Tbp Binding And Ho Expression To A Short Period Within The Cell Cycle. Furthermore, The Synthetic Lethality Resulting From Combining A Gcn5 Mutation With Specific Tbp Point Mutations Can Be Suppressed By The Overexpression Of Transcription Factor Iia (Tfiia), Suggesting That Histone Acetylation By Gcn5 Can Stimulate Transcription By Promoting The Formation Of A Tbp/Tfiia Complex.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Changing the DNA landscape: putting a SPN on chromatin. In Eukaryotic Cells, Transcription And Replication Each Occur On Dna Templates That Are Incorporated Into Nucleosomes. Formation Of Chromatin Generally Limits Accessibility Of Specific Dna Sequences And Inhibits Progression Of Polymerases As They Copy Information From The Dna. The Processes That Select Sites For Initiating Either Transcription Or Replication Are Therefore Strongly Influenced By Factors That Modulate The Properties Of Chromatin Proteins. Further, In Order To Elongate Their Products, Both Dna And Rna Polymerases Must Be Able To Overcome The Inhibition Presented By Chromatin (Lipford And Bell 2001; Workman And Kingston 1998). One Way To Adjust The Properties Of Chromatin Proteins Is To Covalently Modify Them By Adding Or Removing Chemical Moieties. Both Histone And Non-Histone Chromatin Proteins Are Altered By Acetylation, Methylation, And Other Changes, And The 'Nucleosome Modifying' Complexes That Perform These Reactions Are Important Components Of Pathways Of Transcriptional Regulation (Cote 2002; Orphanides And Reinberg 2000; Roth Et Al. 2001; Strahl And Allis 2000; Workman And Kingston 1998). Another Way To Alter The Effects Of Nucleosomes Is To Change The Position Of The Histone Octamers Relative To Specific Dna Sequences (Orphanides And Reinberg 2000; Verrijzer 2002; Wang 2002; Workman And Kingston 1998). Since The Ability Of A Sequence To Be Bound By Specific Proteins Can Vary Significantly Whether The Sequence Is In The Linkers Between Nucleosomes Or At Various Positions Within A Nucleosome, 'Nucleosome Remodeling' Complexes That Rearrange Nucleosome Positioning Are Also Important Regulators Of Transcription. Since The Dna Replication Machinery Has To Encounter Many Of The Same Challenges Posed By Chromatin, It Seems Likely That Modifying And Remodeling Complexes Also Act During Duplication Of The Genome, But Most Of The Current Information On These Factors Relates To Regulation Of Transcription. This Chapter Describes The Factor Known Variously As Fact In Humans, Where It Promotes Elongation Of Rna Polymerase Ii On Nucleosomal Templates In Vitro (Orphanides Et Al. 1998, 1999), Duf In Frogs, Where It Is Needed For Dna Replication In Oocyte Extracts (Okuhara Et Al. 1999), And Cp Or Spn In Yeast, Where It Is Linked In Vivo To Both Transcription And Replication (Brewster Et Al. 2001; Formosa Et Al. 2001). Like The Nucleosome Modifying And Remodeling Complexes, It Is Broadly Conserved Among Eukaryotes, Affects A Wide Range Of Processes That Utilize Chromatin, And Directly Alters The Properties Of Nucleosomes. However, It Does Not Have Nucleosome Modifying Or Standard Atp-Dependent Remodeling Activity, And Therefore Represents A Third Class Of Chromatin Modulating Factors. It Is Also Presently Unique In The Extensive Connections It Displays With Both Transcription And Replication: Fact/Duf/Cp/Spn Appears To Modify Nucleosomes In A Way That Is Directly Important For The Efficient Functioning Of Both Rna Polymerases And Dna Polymerases. While Less Is Known About The Mechanisms It Uses To Promote Its Functions Than For Other Factors That Affect Chromatin, It Is Clearly An Essential Part Of The Complex Mixture Of Activities That Modulate Access To Dna Within Chromatin. Physical And Genetic Interactions Suggest That Fact/Duf/Cp/Spn Affects Multiple Pathways Within Replication And Transcription As A Member Of Several Distinct Complexes. Some Of The Interactions Are Easy To Assimilate Into Models For Replication Or Transcription, Such As Direct Binding To Dna Polymerase Alpha (Wittmeyer And Formosa 1997; Wittmeyer Et Al. 1999), Association With Nucleosome Modifying Complexes (John Et Al. 2000), And Interaction With Factors That Participate In Elongation Of Rna Polymerase Ii (Gavin Et Al. 2002; Squazzo Et Al. 2002). Others Are More Surprising Such As An Association With The 19S Complex That Regulates The Function Of The 20S Proteasome (Ferdous Et Al. 2001; Xu Et Al. 1995), And The Indication That Fact/Duf/Cp/Spn Can Act As A Specificity Factor For Casein Kinase Ii (Keller Et Al. 2001). This Chapter Reviews The Varied Approaches That Have Each Revealed Different Aspects Of The Function Of Fact/Duf/Cp/Spn, And Presents A Picture Of A Factor That Can Both Alter Nucleosomes And Orchestrate The Assembly Or Activity Of A Broad Range Of Complexes That Act Upon Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A new role for the transcriptional corepressor SIN3; regulation of centromeres. Centromeres Play A Vital Role In Maintaining The Genomic Stability Of Eukaryotes By Coordinating The Equal Distribution Of Chromosomes To Daughter Cells During Mitosis And Meiosis. Fission Yeast (S. Pombe) Centromeres Consist Of A 4-9 Kb Central Core Region And 30-100 Kb Of Flanking Inner (Imr/B) And Outer (Otr/K) Repeats. These Sequences Direct A Laminar Kinetochore Structure Similar To That Of Human Centromeres. Centromeric Heterochromatin Is Generally Underacetylated. We Have Previously Shown That Inhibition Of Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Caused Hyperacetylation Of Centromeres And Defective Chromosome Segregation. Sin3 Is A Hdac Corepressor That Has The Ability To Mediate Hdac Targeting In The Repression Of Promoters. In This Study, We Have Characterized S. Pombe Sin Three Corepressors (Pst1P And Pst2P) To Investigate Whether Sin3-Hdac Is Required In The Regulation Of Centromeres. We Show That Only Pst1-1 And Not Pst2Delta Cells Displayed Anaphase Defects And Thiabendazole Sensitivity. Pst1-1 Cells Showed Reduced Centromeric Silencing, Increased Histone Acetylation In Centromeric Chromatin, And Defective Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion. The Hdac Clr6P And Pst1P Coimmunoprecipitated, And Pst1P Colocalized With Centromeres, Particularly In Binucleate Cells. These Data Are Consistent With A Model In Which Pst1P-Clr6P Temporally Associate With Centromeres To Carry Out The Initial Deacetylation Necessary For Subsequent Steps In Heterochromatin Formation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The tor pathway regulates gene expression by linking nutrient sensing to histone acetylation. The Tor Pathway Mediates Cell Growth In Response To Nutrient Availability, In Part By Inducing Ribosomal Protein (Rp) Gene Expression Via An Unknown Mechanism. Expression Of Rp Genes Coincides With Recruitment Of The Esa1 Histone Acetylase To Rp Gene Promoters. We Show That Inhibition Of Tor With Rapamycin Releases Esa1 From Rp Gene Promoters And Leads To Histone H4 Deacetylation Without Affecting Promoter Occupancy By Rap1 And Abf1. Genetic And Biochemical Evidence Identifies Rpd3 As The Major Histone Deacetylase Responsible For Reversing Histone H4 Acetylation At Rp Gene Promoters In Response To Tor Inhibition By Rapamycin Or Nutrient Limitation. Our Results Illustrate That The Tor Pathway Links Nutrient Sensing With Histone Acetylation To Control Rp Gene Expression And Cell Growth.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Rhythmic histone acetylation underlies transcription in the mammalian circadian clock. In The Mouse Circadian Clock, A Transcriptional Feedback Loop Is At The Centre Of The Clockwork Mechanism. Clock And Bmal1 Are Essential Transcription Factors That Drive The Expression Of Three Period Genes (Per1-3) And Two Cryptochrome Genes (Cry1 And Cry2). The Cry Proteins Feedback To Inhibit Clock/Bmal1-Mediated Transcription By A Mechanism That Does Not Alter Clock/Bmal1 Binding To Dna. Here We Show That Transcriptional Regulation Of The Core Clock Mechanism In Mouse Liver Is Accompanied By Rhythms In H3 Histone Acetylation, And That H3 Acetylation Is A Potential Target Of The Inhibitory Action Of Cry. The Promoter Regions Of The Per1, Per2 And Cry1 Genes Exhibit Circadian Rhythms In H3 Acetylation And Rna Polymerase Ii Binding That Are Synchronous With The Corresponding Steady-State Messenger Rna Rhythms. The Histone Acetyltransferase P300 Precipitates Together With Clock In Vivo In A Time-Dependent Manner. Moreover, The Cry Proteins Inhibit A P300-Induced Increase In Clock/Bmal1-Mediated Transcription. The Delayed Timing Of The Cry1 Mrna Rhythm, Relative To The Per Rhythms, Is Due To The Coordinated Activities Of Rev-Erbalpha And Clock/Bmal1, And Defines A New Mechanism For Circadian Phase Control.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast. Histone Deacetylases, Typified By Class I Rpd3 In The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Have Historically Been Associated With Gene Repression. We Now Demonstrate That Hos2, Another Member Of The Class I Family, Binds To The Coding Regions Of Genes Primarily During Gene Activation, When It Specifically Deacetylates The Lysines In H3 And H4 Histone Tails. Moreover, Hos2 Is Preferentially Associated With Genes Of High Activity Genome-Wide. We Also Show That Hos2 And An Associated Factor, Set3, Are Necessary For Efficient Transcription. Therefore, Our Data Indicate That, In Contrast To Other Class I Histone Deacetylases, Hos2 Is Directly Required For Gene Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Post-activation turn-off of NF-kappa B-dependent transcription is regulated by acetylation of p65. Nf-Kappab Represents A Family Of Eukaryotic Transcription Factors Participating In The Regulation Of Various Cellular Genes Involved In The Immediate Early Processes Of Immune, Acute-Phase, And Inflammatory Responses. Cellular Localization And Consequently The Transcriptional Activity Of Nf-Kappab Is Tightly Regulated By Its Partner Ikappabalpha. Here, We Show That The P65 Subunit Of Nf-Kappab Is Acetylated By Both P300 And Pcaf On Lysines 122 And 123. Both Hdac2 And Hdac3 Interact With P65, Although Only Hdac3 Was Able To Deacetylate P65. Acetylation Of P65 Reduces Its Ability To Bind Kappabeta-Dna. Finally, Acetylation Of P65 Facilitated Its Removal From Dna And Consequently Its Ikappabetaalpha-Mediated Export From The Nucleus. We Propose That Acetylation Of P65 Plays A Key Role In Ikappabetaalpha-Mediated Attenuation Of Nf-Kappabeta Transcriptional Activity Which Is An Important Process That Restores The Latent State In Post-Induced Cells.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Transcriptional inhibition of genes with severe histone h3 hypoacetylation in the coding region. Changes In Histone Acetylation At Promoters Correlate With Transcriptional Activation And Repression, But Whether Acetylation Of Histones In The Coding Region Of Genes Is Important For Transcription Is Less Clear. Here, We Show That Cells Lacking The Histone Acetyltransferases Gcn5 And Elp3 Have Widespread And Severe Histone H3 Hypoacetylation In Chromatin. Surprisingly, Severe Hypoacetylation In The Promoter Does Not Invariably Affect The Ability Of Tbp To Bind The Tata Element, Or Transcription Of The Gene. By Contrast, Similar Hypoacetylation Of The Coding Region Correlates With Inhibition Of Transcription, And Inhibition Correlates Better With The Overall Charge Of The Histone H3 Tail Than With Hypoacetylation Of Specific Lysine Residues. These Data Provide Insights Into The Effects Of Histone H3 Hypoacetylation In Vivo And Underscore The Importance Of The Overall Charge Of The Histone Tail For Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromosomal gradient of histone acetylation established by Sas2p and Sir2p functions as a shield against gene silencing. Genes Located In Chromosomal Regions Near Telomeres Are Transcriptionally Silent, Whereas Those Located In Regions Away From Telomeres Are Not. Here We Show That There Is A Gradient Of Acetylation Of Histone H4 At Lysine 16 (H4-Lys16) Along A Yeast Chromosome; This Gradient Ranges From A Hypoacetylated State In Regions Near The Telomere To A Hyperacetylated State In More Distant Regions. The Hyperacetylation Is Regulated By Sas2P, A Member Of The Myst-Type Family Of Histone Acetylases, Whereas Hypoacetylation Is Under The Control Of Sir2P, A Histone Deacetylase. Loss Of Hyperacetylation Is Accompanied By An Increase In Localization Of The Telomere Protein Sir3P And The Inactivation Of Gene Expression In Telomere-Distal Regions. Thus, The Sas2P And Sir2P Function In Concert To Regulate Transcription In Yeast, By Acetylating And Deacetylating H4-Lys16 In A Mechanism That May Be Common To All Eukaryotes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Histone Acetylation And Deacetylation Are Chromatin-Modifying Processes That Have Fundamental Importance For Transcriptional Regulation. Transcriptionally Active Chromatin Regions Show A High Degree Of Histone Acetylation, Whereas Deacetylation Events Are Generally Linked To Transcriptional Silencing. Many Of The Acetylating And Deacetylating Enzymes Were Originally Identified As Transcriptional Coactivators Or Repressors. Their Histone-Modifying Enzymatic Activity Was Discovered More Recently, Opening Up A Whole New Area Of Research. Histone Acetyltransferases Such As Creb-Binding Protein (Cbp) And Pcaf Are Involved In Processes As Diverse As Promoting Cell Cycle Progression And Regulating Differentiation. A Controlled Balance Between Histone Acetylation And Deacetylation Seems To Be Essential For Normal Cell Growth. Both Histone Acetyltransferases And Deacetylases Are Involved In The Development Of Diseases, Including Neurodegenerative Disorders And Cancer. Treatments That Target These Enzymes Are Already Under Clinical Investigation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylation and accessibility of rDNA chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in (Delta)top1 and (Delta)sir2 mutants. The Insertion Of Reporter Genes In The Ribosomal Dna (Rdna) Locus Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Causes Their Transcriptional Repression. This Kind Of Transcriptional Silencing Depends On Proteins Such As Sir2P And Top1P, And Has Been Shown To Be Mediated By Chromatin. While Sir2P Modifies Nucleosomes Directly Through Its Histone Deacetylase Activity, Little Is Known About Changes In The Chromatin Structure That Occur At The Rdna Locus When Top1 Is Deleted. Here, We Show That The Absence Of Top1P Causes Increased Histone Acetylation At The Rdna Locus. Moreover, Rdna Chromatin Becomes More Accessible In A Similar Manner In Both Top1 And Sir2 Mutant Strains.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Targeted histone acetylation at the yeast CUP1 promoter requires the transcriptional activator, the TATA boxes, and the putative histone acetylase encoded by SPT10. The Relationship Between Chromatin Remodeling And Histone Acetylation At The Yeast Cup1 Gene Was Addressed. Cup1 Encodes A Metallothionein Required For Cell Growth At High Copper Concentrations. Induction Of Cup1 With Copper Resulted In Targeted Acetylation Of Both H3 And H4 At The Cup1 Promoter. Nucleosomes Containing Upstream Activating Sequences And Sequences Farther Upstream Were The Targets For H3 Acetylation. Targeted Acetylation Of H3 And H4 Required The Transcriptional Activator (Ace1P) And The Tata Boxes, Suggesting That Targeted Acetylation Occurs When Tata-Binding Protein Binds To The Tata Box Or At A Later Stage In Initiation. We Have Shown Previously That Induction Results In Nucleosome Repositioning Over The Entire Cup1 Gene, Which Requires Ace1P But Not The Tata Boxes. Therefore, The Movement Of Nucleosomes Occurring On Cup1 Induction Is Independent Of Targeted Acetylation. Targeted Acetylation Of Both H3 And H4 Also Required The Product Of The Spt10 Gene, Which Encodes A Putative Histone Acetylase Implicated In Regulation At Core Promoters. Disruption Of Spt10 Was Lethal At High Copper Concentrations And Correlated With Slower Induction And Reduced Maximum Levels Of Cup1 Mrna. These Observations Constitute Evidence For A Novel Mechanism Of Chromatin Activation At Cup1, With A Major Role For The Tata Box.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylated, methylated, remodeled: chromatin states for gene regulation. The Activity State Of A Gene Is Determined Not Only By Sequence-Specific Regulatory Factors But Also By A Complex Network Of Co-Acting Proteins. Many Of These Proteins Directly Or Indirectly Affect The Structure Of The Chromatin Environment Into Which The Gene Is Embedded. Recent Studies Of Histone And Dna Modifications Support And Refine The Concept Of The Chromatin Environment Being Key To The Establishment And Maintenance Of Transcriptional Activity Or Repression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Ets1 is required for p53 transcriptional activity in UV-induced apoptosis in embryonic stem cells. Embryonic Stem (Es) Cells Contain A P53-Dependent Apoptosis Mechanism To Avoid The Continued Proliferation And Differentiation Of Damaged Cells. We Show That Mouse Es Cells Lacking Ets1 Are Deficient In Their Ability To Undergo Uv-Induced Apoptosis, Similar To P53 Null Es Cells. In Ets1(-/-) Es Cells, Uv Induction Of The P53 Regulated Genes Mdm2, Perp, Cyclin G And Bax Was Decreased Both At Mrna And Protein Levels. While P53 Protein Levels Were Unaltered In Ets1(-/-) Cells, Its Ability To Transactivate Genes Such As Mdm2 And Cyclin G Was Reduced. Furthermore, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays And Immunoprecipitations Demonstrated That The Presence Of Ets1 Was Necessary For A Cbp/P53 Complex To Be Formed. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations Demonstrated That Ets1 Was Required For The Formation Of A Stable P53-Dna Complex Under Physiological Conditions And Activation Of Histone Acetyltransferase Activity. These Data Demonstrate That Ets1 Is An Essential Component Of A Uv-Responsive P53 Transcriptional Activation Complex In Es Cells And Suggests That Ets1 May Contribute To The Specificity Of P53-Dependent Gene Transactivation In Distinct Cellular Compartments.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Helix 12 in the human estrogen receptor (hER) is essential for the hER function by overcoming nucleosome repression in yeast. When Exogenous Human Estrogen Receptor (Her) Binds With Estrogen, It Can Activate Transcription Of Target Genes In Yeast Cells. The Estrogen Dose-Response Expression Patterns In Yeast Are Very Similar To Those In Human Cells. This Implies That Her May Function In Yeast Cells Via Mechanisms Similar To Those In Human Cells. In This Study, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Was Used To Dissect Mechanisms Of Her-Activated Transcription In Yeast. The Her Contains Two Transcription Activation Domains: Er-Af-1 And Er-Af-2 (Lbd Or Hbd). In Both Human And Wild-Type Yeast Cells, Her Must Bind With Estrogen In Order To Activate Transcription. In Those Cells, Er-Af-2 Is Independently Active Upon Hormone Binding, But Er-Af-1 By Itself Is Inactive. In A Mutagenesis Screen, We Found A Mutant Strain In Which The Er-Af-1 Was Independently Active. It Was Determined That This Mutant Strain Carried A Tup1 Mutation. More Interestingly, A Small Her Fragment Er-Af-0, Containing Neither Er-Af-1 Nor Er-Af-2, Was Also Fully Active In The Deltatup1 Cells. This Suggests That In This Strain, Hormone Binding Is Not Required For Transcription Activation By Her. It Is Known That The Tup1/Ssn6 Complex Plays An Important Role In General Transcription Repression By Protecting Histone Acetylation Sites Thus Stabilizing Nucleosomes. In The Deltatup1 Cells, Nucleosomes Are Known To Be Unstable Because Histones Can Be Easily Accessed By Acetylase And Cause Nucleosome Disassociation. Two Point Mutations In Helix 12 (H12) In Er-Af-2, Which Abolished Her Function In Human Cells, Also Completely Abolished Her Function In The Wild-Type Yeast Cells. This Suggested That H12 Is Essential For Her Transcription Activation Function. However, Her With The H12 Mutation Is Able To Activate Transcription In Deltatup1 Cells. This Indicates That The Normal Function Of H12 Is Required For Transcription Activation By Her Only If Nucleosomes Are Not Acetylated And Are Therefore Stable. The Results Of This Work Suggest That There Is A Close Relationship Between Her Function And Nucleosome Remodeling. It Also Provides Insight About H12 Activity And Its Functional Relationship With Other Domains In Her. We Propose Here That H12 Is Essential For Her Function By Recruiting Strong Nucleosome Remodeling Proteins To The Promoter Region Thus Overcoming Nucleosome Repression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Genome-wide binding map of the histone deacetylase Rpd3 in yeast. We Describe The Genome-Wide Distribution Of The Histone Deacetylase And Repressor Rpd3 And Its Associated Proteins Ume1 And Ume6 In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Using A New Cross-Linking Protocol, We Found That Rpd3 Binds Upstream Of Many Individual Genes And Upstream Of Members Of Gene Classes With Similar Functions In Anabolic Processes. In Addition, Rpd3 Is Preferentially Associated With Promoters That Direct High Transcriptional Activity. We Also Found That Rpd3 Was Absent From Large Sub-Telomeric Domains. We Show By Co-Immunoprecipitation And By The High Similarity Of Their Binding Maps That Ume1 Interacts With Rpd3. In Contrast, Despite The Known Role Of Ume6 In Rpd3 Recruitment, Only A Limited Number Of The Genes Targeted By Rpd3 Are Also Enriched For (Or Targeted By) Ume6. This Suggests That Rpd3 Is Brought To Many Promoters By Alternative Recruiters, Some Of Which May Bind The Putative Cis-Regulatory Dna Elements That We Have Identified In Sets Of Rpd3 Target Genes. Finally, We Show That Comparing The Genome-Wide Pattern Of Rpd3 Binding With Gene Expression And Histone Acetylation In The Rpd3 Delta Mutant Strain Reveals New Sites Of Rpd3 Function.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Microarray deacetylation maps determine genome-wide functions for yeast histone deacetylases. Yeast Contains A Family Of Five Related Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Whose Functions Are Known At Few Genes. Therefore, We Used Chromatin Immunoprecipitation And Intergenic Microarrays To Generate Genome-Wide Hdac Enzyme Activity Maps. Rpd3 And Hda1 Deacetylate Mainly Distinct Promoters And Gene Classes Where They Are Recruited Largely By Novel Mechanisms. Hda1 Also Deacetylates Subtelomeric Domains Containing Normally Repressed Genes That Are Used Instead For Gluconeogenesis, Growth On Carbon Sources Other Than Glucose, And Adverse Growth Conditions. These Domains Have Certain Features Of Heterochromatin But Are Distinct From Subtelomeric Heterochromatin Repressed By The Deacetylase Sir2. Finally, Hos1/Hos3 And Hos2 Preferentially Affect Ribosomal Dna And Ribosomal Protein Genes, Respectively. Thus, Acetylation Microarrays Uncover The "Division Of Labor" For Yeast Histone Deacetylases.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Steps in assembly of silent chromatin in yeast: Sir3-independent binding of a Sir2/Sir4 complex to silencers and role for Sir2-dependent deacetylation. Transcriptional Silencing At The Budding Yeast Silent Mating Type (Hm) Loci And Telomeric Dna Regions Requires Sir2, A Conserved Nad-Dependent Histone Deacetylase, Sir3, Sir4, Histones H3 And H4, And Several Dna-Binding Proteins. Silencing At The Yeast Ribosomal Dna (Rdna) Repeats Requires A Complex Containing Sir2, Net1, And Cdc14. Here We Show That The Native Sir2/Sir4 Complex Is Composed Solely Of Sir2 And Sir4 And That Native Sir3 Is Not Associated With Other Proteins. We Further Show That The Initial Binding Of The Sir2/Sir4 Complex To Dna Sites That Nucleate Silencing, Accompanied By Partial Sir2-Dependent Histone Deacetylation, Occurs Independently Of Sir3 And Is Likely To Be The First Step In Assembly Of Silent Chromatin At The Hm Loci And Telomeres. The Enzymatic Activity Of Sir2 Is Not Required For This Initial Binding, But Is Required For The Association Of Silencing Proteins With Regions Distal From Nucleation Sites. At The Rdna Repeats, We Show That Histone H3 And H4 Tails Are Required For Silencing And Rdna-Associated H4 Is Hypoacetylated In A Sir2-Dependent Manner. However, The Binding Of Sir2 To Rdna Is Independent Of Its Histone Deacetylase Activity. Together, These Results Support A Stepwise Model For The Assembly Of Silent Chromatin Domains In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The MYST domain acetyltransferase Chameau functions in epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional repression. Reversible Acetylation Of Histone Tails Plays An Important Role In Chromatin Remodelling And Regulation Of Gene Activity. While Modification By Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Is Usually Linked To Transcriptional Activation, We Provide Here Evidence For Hat Function In Several Types Of Epigenetic Repression. Chameau (Chm), A New Drosophila Member Of The Myst Hat Family, Dominantly Suppresses Position Effect Variegation (Pev), Is Required For The Maintenance Of Hox Gene Silencing By Polycomb Group (Pcg) Proteins, And Can Partially Substitute For The Myst Sas2 Hat In Yeast Telomeric Position Effect (Tpe). Finally, We Provide In Vivo Evidence That The Acetyltransferase Activity Of Chm Is Required In These Processes, Since A Variant Protein Mutated In The Catalytic Domain No Longer Rescues Pev Modification, Telomeric Silencing Of Sas2-Deficient Yeast Cells, Nor Lethality Of Chm Mutant Flies. These Findings Emphasize The Role Of An Acetyltransferase In Gene Silencing, Which Supports, According To The Histone Code Hypothesis, That Transcription At A Particular Locus Is Determined By A Precise Combination Of Histone Tail Modifications Rather Than By Overall Acetylation Levels.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Modulating acetyl-CoA binding in the GCN5 family of histone acetyltransferases. The Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Gcn5 Is The Founding Member For A Family Of Chromatin Remodeling Enzymes. Gcn5 Is The Catalytic Subunit Of A Large Multi-Subunit Complex That Functions In The Regulation Of Gene Activation Via Acetylation Of Lysine Residues Within The N-Terminal Tails Of Core Histone Proteins. Using Acetyl-Coa As A Co-Substrate, The High Affinity Binding Of Acetyl-Coa Is A Critical First Step In The Reaction. Here, We Examine The Biochemical And Biological Importance Of A Conserved Hydroxyl-Bearing Residue In Signature Motif A. Interestingly, One Major Exception Is The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Gcn5, Where An Alanine (Ala(190)) Is Located In The Corresponding Position. In Related Gcn5 Family Structures, A Hydroxyl-Containing Side Chain Residue Is Hydrogen-Bonded To The Alpha-Phosphate Oxygen Of Coa. We Demonstrate That This Key Hydrogen Bond Contributes Approximately 10-Fold To The Binding Affinity Of Gcn5 Hats For Acetyl-Coa. Human P300/Cbp-Associating Factor, Human Gcn5, And Tetrahymena Gcn5 Displayed Dissociation Constants (K(D)) For Acetyl-Coa Of 0.64 +/- 0.12, 0.56 +/- 0.15, And 0.62 +/- 0.17 Microm, Respectively. In Contrast, S. Cerevisiae Gcn5 Displayed A K(D) Of 8.5 Microm. When Ala(190) Was Replaced With Threonine, The A190T Derivative Yielded A K(D) Value Of 0.56 +/- 0.1 Microm For Acetyl-Coa, Completely Restoring The Higher Affinity Binding Seen With The Gcn5 Homologs That Naturally Harbor A Threonine At This Position. Detailed Kinetic Analyses Revealed That The A190T Derivative Was Otherwise Catalytically Indistinguishable From Wild Type Gcn5. We Also Demonstrate That The A190T Allele Rescued The Slow Growth Phenotype And The Defect In Ho Transcription Caused By A Deletion Of Gcn5. Furthermore, The A190T Allele Supported Wild Type Levels Of Transcriptionally Targeted And Global Histone H3 Acetylation. In Each Case, The A190T Derivative Behaved Similarly To Wild Type Gcn5, Suggesting That The Efficacy Of Hat Activity By Gcn5 Is Not Limited By The Availability Of Nuclear Acetyl-Coa Pools.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation and recruitment of serum responsive factor and CREB-binding protein onto SM22 promoter during SM22 gene expression. Chromatin Acetylation And Deacetylation Catalyzed By Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) And Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Are Closely Related To Eukaryotic Gene Transcription. Although The Binding Of Serum Response Factor (Srf) To The Carg Boxes In The Promoter Region Is Necessary For Sm22 Expression, It Has Never Been Examined Whether The Local Chromatin Modification Is Involved In Sm22 Gene Regulation. In This Study, We Used The Sm22 Gene As A Model To Address Whether Transcriptional Activation Of The Gene Can Be Manipulated Through Adjusting Histone Acetylation Of The Chromatin Template And Whether Srf- And Hat-Containing Coactivators Can Be Recruited Onto The Sm22 Promoter Region During Gene Activation. Here, We Showed That The Stimulation Of The Sm22 Promoter By The Coactivator Creb-Binding Protein (Cbp) Was Dependent On Hat Activity. Overexpression Of Hdacs Decreased Sm22 Promoter Activity, Whereas Trichostatin A, An Hdac Inhibitor, Stimulated Sm22 Promoter Activity In A Carg Box-Dependent Manner And Induced Endogenous Sm22 Gene Expression. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays Showed That Trichostatin A Treatment In 10T1/2 Cells Induces Chromatin Hyperacetylation In The Sm22 Gene. Although Histone Hyperacetylation Of The Sm22 Gene Occurred During Sm22 Gene Expression And Srf And Cbp Immunocomplexes Possess Hat Activities In Smooth Muscle Cells, Both Srf And Cbp Were Recruited To The Carg Box-Containing Region Of The Promoter. This Study Provides Evidence That Chromatin Acetylation Is Involved In Smooth Muscle Cell-Specific Gene Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The interaction of Alba, a conserved archaeal chromatin protein, with Sir2 and its regulation by acetylation. The Conserved Sir2 Family Of Proteins Has Protein Deacetylase Activity That Is Dependent On Nad (The Oxidized Form Of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide). Although Histones Are One Likely Target For The Enzymatic Activity Of Eukaryotic Sir2 Proteins, Little Is Known About The Substrates And Roles Of Prokaryotic Sir2 Homologs. We Reveal That An Archaeal Sir2 Homolog Interacts Specifically With The Major Archaeal Chromatin Protein, Alba, And That Alba Exists In Acetylated And Nonacetylated Forms. Furthermore, We Show That Sir2 Can Deacetylate Alba And Mediate Transcriptional Repression In A Reconstituted In Vitro Transcription System. These Data Provide A Paradigm For How Sir2 Family Proteins Influence Transcription And Suggest That Modulation Of Chromatin Structure By Acetylation Arose Before The Divergence Of The Archaeal And Eukaryotic Lineages.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Angiotensinogen gene expression is dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-mediated p300/cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein coactivator recruitment and histone acetyltransferase activity. Angiotensin Ii, A Potent Vasoactive Peptide Produced By Proteolysis Of The Angiotensinogen (Agt) Prohormone, Plays A Critical Role In Cardiovascular Homeostasis. Recently We Showed That Il-6 Induces Human (H)Agt Transcription By Activating The Signal Transducers And Activators Of Transcription (Stats). Here We Investigated The Role Of The Coactivator P300/Camp Response Element Binding Protein-Binding Protein (Cbp) In Stat3-Mediated Hagt Gene Expression. Overexpression Of Adenovirus 12S E1A, Which Binds And Inactivates P300/Cbp, Strongly Inhibited Basal And Stimulated Hagt Transcription, Whereas A Mutant E1A Defective In Binding P300/Cbp Did Not. Conversely, Ectopic Expression Of P300 And Cbp Potentiated Inducible Hagt Promoter Activity. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays Revealed Stat3-P300 Interaction Upon Il-6 Stimulation. The Stat3-P300 Association Requires The Stat3 C-Terminal Transactivation Domain, As Stat3 Deleted Of Transactivation Functions As A Dominant-Negative Inhibitor And Does Not Associate With P300/Cbp. The Observation That Il-6 Stimulation Increases Histone H4 Acetylation Of The Endogenous Hagt Promoter, And Expression Of P300 Deficient In Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Down-Regulates Hagt Promoter Activity Both Suggest That P300 Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Is Required For Hagt Expression. Finally, Treatment Of Hepg2 Cells With A Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Increased The Hagt Mrna Abundance By 2- To 3-Fold. Taken Together, Our Results Indicate That Il-6-Inducible Expression Of The Hagt Promoter Is Mediated By Physical Association Of The Cooh Terminus Of Stat3 With P300/Cbp, The Recruitment Of Which Targets Histone Acetylation And Results In Chromatin Remodeling.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone deacetylases and cancer: causes and therapies. Together, Histone Acetyltransferases And Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Determine The Acetylation Status Of Histones. This Acetylation Affects The Regulation Of Gene Expression, And Inhibitors Of Hdacs Have Been Found To Cause Growth Arrest, Differentiation And/Or Apoptosis Of Many Tumours Cells By Altering The Transcription Of A Small Number Of Genes. Hdac Inhibitors Are Proving To Be An Exciting Therapeutic Approach To Cancer, But How Do They Exert This Effect?
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	ChIPs of the beta-globin locus: unraveling gene regulation within an active domain. Recent Studies Of Beta-Globin Gene Expression Have Concentrated On The Analysis Of Factor Binding And Chromatin Structure Within The Endogenous Locus. These Studies Have More Precisely Defined The Extent And Nature Of The Active Chromosomal Domain And The Elements That Organize It. Surprisingly, The Beta-Globin Locus Control Region (Lcr), Although Critical For High-Level Gene Expression, Plays Little Role In The Overall Architecture Of The Active Locus. Analysis Of The Effects Of Targeted Deletion Of The Beta-Globin Lcr, Along With Emerging Knowledge Of The Behavior Of The Erythroid Transcription Factor Nf-E2, Leads To A New Perspective On Factor Binding And Lcr Function.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone modifications in transcriptional regulation. Covalent Modifications Of The Amino Termini Of The Core Histones In Nucleosomes Have Important Roles In Gene Regulation. Research In The Past Two Years Reveals These Modifications To Consist Of Phosphorylation, Methylation And Ubiquitination, In Addition To The Better-Characterized Acetylation. This Multiplicity Of Modifications, And Their Occurrence In Patterns And Dependent Sequences, Argues Persuasively For The Existence Of A Histone Code.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Coordination of PIC assembly and chromatin remodeling during differentiation-induced gene activation. We Analyzed The Ordered Recruitment Of Factors To The Human Alpha1 Antitrypsin Promoter Around The Initial Activation Of The Gene During Enterocyte Differentiation. We Found That A Complete Preinitiation Complex, Including Phosphorylated Rna Pol Ii, Was Assembled At The Promoter Long Before Transcriptional Activation. The Histone Acetyltransferases Cbp And P/Caf Were Recruited Subsequently, But Local Histone Hyperacetylation Was Delayed. After Transient Recruitment Of The Human Brahma Homolog Hbrm, Remodeling Of The Neighboring Nucleosome Coincided With Transcription Initiation. The Results Suggest That, At This Promoter, Chromatin Reconfiguration Is A Defining Step Of The Initiation Process, Acting After The Assembly Of The Pol Ii Machinery.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Modulation of ISWI function by site-specific histone acetylation. Mutations In Drosophila Iswi, A Member Of The Swi2/Snf2 Family Of Chromatin Remodeling Atpases, Alter The Global Architecture Of The Male X Chromosome. The Transcription Of Genes On This Chromosome Is Increased 2-Fold Relative To Females Due To Dosage Compensation, A Process Involving The Acetylation Of Histone H4 At Lysine 16 (H4K16). Here We Show That Blocking H4K16 Acetylation Suppresses The X Chromosome Defects Resulting From Loss Of Iswi Function In Males. In Contrast, The Forced Acetylation Of H4K16 In Iswi Mutant Females Causes X Chromosome Defects Indistinguishable From Those Seen In Iswi Mutant Males. Increased Expression Of Mof, The Histone Acetyltransferase That Acetylates H4K16, Strongly Enhances Phenotypes Resulting From The Partial Loss Of Iswi Function. Peptide Competition Assays Revealed That H4K16 Acetylation Reduces The Ability Of Iswi To Interact Productively With Its Substrate. These Findings Suggest That H4K16 Acetylation Directly Counteracts Chromatin Compaction Mediated By The Iswi Atpase.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation: a switch between repressive and permissive chromatin. Second in review series on chromatin dynamics. The Organization Of Eukaryotic Chromatin Has A Major Impact On All Nuclear Processes Involving Dna Substrates. Gene Expression Is Affected By The Positioning Of Individual Nucleosomes Relative To Regulatory Sequence Elements, By The Folding Of The Nucleosomal Fiber Into Higher-Order Structures And By The Compartmentalization Of Functional Domains Within The Nucleus. Because Site-Specific Acetylation Of Nucleosomal Histones Influences All Three Aspects Of Chromatin Organization, It Is Central To The Switch Between Permissive And Repressive Chromatin Structure. The Targeting Of Enzymes That Modulate The Histone Acetylation Status Of Chromatin, In Synergy With The Effects Mediated By Other Chromatin Remodeling Factors, Is Central To Gene Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Hyperacetylation of chromatin at the ADH2 promoter allows Adr1 to bind in repressed conditions. We Report That In Vivo Increased Acetylation Of The Repressed Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Adh2 Promoter Chromatin, As Obtained By Disrupting The Genes For The Two Deacetylases Hda1 And Rpd3, Destabilizes The Structure Of The Tata Box-Containing Nucleosome. This Acetylation-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Is Not Sufficient To Allow The Binding Of The Tata Box-Binding Protein, But Facilitates The Recruitment Of The Transcriptional Activator Adr1 And Induces Faster Kinetics Of Mrna Accumulation When The Cells Are Shifted To Derepressing Conditions.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The roX genes encode redundant male-specific lethal transcripts required for targeting of the MSL complex. The Rox1 And Rox2 Genes Of Drosophila Produce Male-Specific Non-Coding Rnas That Co-Localize With The Male-Specific Lethal (Msl) Protein Complex. This Complex Mediates Up-Regulation Of The Male X Chromosome By Increasing Histone H4 Acetylation, Thus Contributing To The Equalization Of X-Linked Gene Expression Between The Sexes. Both Rox Genes Overlap Two Of Approximately 35 Chromatin Entry Sites, Dna Sequences Proposed To Act In Cis To Direct The Msl Complex To The X Chromosome. Although Dosage Compensation Is Essential In Males, An Intact Rox1 Gene Is Not Required By Either Sex. We Have Generated Flies Lacking Rox2 And Find That This Gene Is Also Non-Essential. However, Simultaneous Removal Of Both Rox Rnas Causes A Striking Male-Specific Reduction In Viability Accompanied By Relocation Of The Msl Proteins And Acetylated Histone H4 From The X Chromosome To Autosomal Sites And Heterochromatin. Males Can Be Rescued By Rox Cdnas From Autosomal Transgenes, Demonstrating The Genetic Separation Of The Chromatin Entry And Rna-Encoding Functions. Therefore, The Rox1 And Rox2 Genes Produce Redundant, Male-Specific Lethal Transcripts Required For Targeting The Msl Complex.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The Saccharomyces cerevisiae histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 has a role in the photoreactivation and nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the MFA2 gene. How Dna Repair Enzymes Or Complexes Gain Access To Chromatin Is Still Not Understood. Here, We Have Studied The Role Of The S. Cerevisiae Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 In Photoreactivation (Pr) And Nucleotide Excision Repair (Ner) At The Level Of The Genome, The Mfa2 And Rpb2 Genes, And At Specific Nucleotides Within Mfa2. The Deletion Of Gcn5 Markedly Reduced The Pr And Ner Of Uv-Induced Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimers In Mfa2 But Much Less So In Rpb2, Whereas No Detectable Defect Was Seen For Repair Of The Genome Overall. In Delta(Gcn5), The Mfa2 Mrna Level Is Reduced By Fourfold, While Transcription From Rpb2 Is Reduced Only To 80 %. These Changes In Transcription Correlate With The Changes In Ner And Pr Found In The Delta(Gcn5) Mutant. However, Changes In Mfa2 Transcription Cannot Account For The Decrease In Ner In The Non-Transcribed Strand And The Control Region Of Mfa2 Where Global Genome Repair (Ggr) Operates. We Conclude That The Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Influences Pr And Ner At Mfa2 In Both Its Transcribed And Non-Transcribed Dna, Yet It Has Little Effect On These Processes For Most Of The Yeast Genome. As A Result, We Speculate That Histone Acetylation Allows Efficient Access Of The Repair Machinery To Chromosomal Dna Damages Either Indirectly Via Influencing Transcription Or Directly Via Modifying Chromatin Structure Irrespective Of Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone-dependent association of Tup1-Ssn6 with repressed genes in vivo. The Tup1-Ssn6 Complex Regulates Diverse Classes Of Genes In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Serves As A Model For Corepressor Functions In Many Organisms. Tup1-Ssn6 Does Not Directly Bind Dna But Is Brought To Target Genes Through Interactions With Sequence-Specific Dna Binding Factors. Full Repression By Tup1-Ssn6 Appears To Require Interactions With Both The Histone Tails And Components Of The General Transcription Machinery, Although The Relative Contribution Of These Two Pathways Is Not Clear. Here, We Map Tup1 Locations On Two Classes Of Tup1-Ssn6-Regulated Genes In Vivo Via Chromatin Immunoprecipitations. Distinct Profiles Of Tup1 Are Observed On A Cell-Specific Genes And Dna Damage-Inducible Genes, Suggesting That Alternate Repressive Architectures May Be Created On Different Classes Of Repressed Genes. In Both Cases, Decreases In Acetylation Of Histone H3 Colocalize With Tup1. Strikingly, Although Loss Of The Srb10 Mediator Protein Had No Effect On Tup1 Localization, Both Histone Tail Mutations And Histone Deacetylase Mutations Crippled The Association Of Tup1 With Target Loci. Together With Previous Findings That Tup1-Ssn6 Physically Associates With Histone Deacetylase Activities, These Results Indicate That The Repressor Complex Alters Histone Modification States To Facilitate Interactions With Histones And That These Interactions Are Required To Maintain A Stable Repressive State.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Deregulation of polyamine biosynthesis alters intrinsic histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities in murine skin and tumors. The Essential Requirement For Polyamines For Normal Cell Growth And Differentiation May Be Partly Attributed To Their Influence On Gene Expression, A Process Regulated By The Acetylation State Of Nucleosomal Histones. We Used Transgenic Mice To Examine The Effects Of Constitutive Expression Of Ornithine Decarboxylase (Odc), A Key Rate-Limiting Enzyme In Polyamine Biosynthesis, On Histone Acetylation In Epithelial Cells In Skin. As Compared With The Skin Of Normal Littermate Mice, Both Intrinsic Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) And Deacetylase Activities Are Elevated In Odc Transgenic Skin. Skin Tumors That Form Spontaneously In Odc/Ras Double Transgenic Mice Exhibit Exceptionally High Hat Activity Having A Distinct Specificity For Lys-12 In The Tail Domain Of Histone H4, Which May Have Implications For Gene Transcription. However, Acetylation Of Histones By Hat Enzymes Was Impeded In Cultured Odc Transgenic Keratinocytes, And There Were Only Modest Changes In Levels Of Acetylated Histones In The Skin Of Odc Transgenic Mice. Treatment With The Odc Enzyme Inhibitor Alpha-Difluoromethylornithine, Which Results In Regression Of Odc/Ras Tumors, Reverses The Effects On Hat And Deacetylase Enzyme Function, Implicating Polyamine Biosynthesis In The Regulation Of Histone Acetylation. Polyamines Do Not Directly Stimulate The Enzymatic Activity Of Either P300 Or P300/Creb-Binding Protein (Cbp)-Associated Factor, Members Of Two Distinct Classes Of Hat Enzymes, Implying That The Elevated Cbp/P300-Associated Hat Activity Detected In Odc Transgenic Skin Is Attributable To Indirect Influence Of Polyamines. These Results Suggest That Multiple Mechanisms Exist By Which Endogenous Polyamines Influence Chromatin In Mammals. Furthermore, They Suggest That The Elevated Polyamine Levels Inherent In Many Solid Tumors Alter Chromatin Structure, Likely Affecting Gene Expression And Promoting The Neoplastic Process.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The silencing complex SAS-I links histone acetylation to the assembly of repressed chromatin by CAF-I and Asf1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Acetylation State Of Histones Plays A Central Role In Determining Gene Expression In Chromatin. The Reestablishment Of The Acetylation State Of Nucleosomes After Dna Replication And Chromatin Assembly Requires Both Deacetylation And Acetylation Of Specific Lysine Residues On Newly Incorporated Histones. In This Study, The Myst Family Acetyltransferase Sas2 Was Found To Interact With Cac1, The Largest Subunit Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Chromatin Assembly Factor-I (Caf-I), And With The Nucleosome Assembly Factor Asf1. The Deletions Of Cac1 (Cac1Delta), Asf1 (Asf1Delta), And Sas2 (Sas2Delta) Had Similar Effects On Gene Silencing And Were Partially Overlapping. Furthermore, Sas2 Was Found In A Nuclear Protein Complex That Included Sas4 And Sas5, A Homolog Of Taf(Ii)30. This Complex, Termed Sas-I, Was Also Found To Contribute To Rdna Silencing. Furthermore, The Observation That A Mutation Of H4 Lysine 16 To Arginine Displayed The Identical Silencing Phenotypes As Sas2Delta Suggested That It Was The In Vivo Target Of Sas2 Acetylation. In Summary, Our Data Present A Novel Model For The Reestablishment Of Acetylation Patterns After Dna Replication, By Which Sas-I Is Recruited To Freshly Replicated Dna By Its Association With Chromatin Assembly Complexes To Acetylate Lysine 16 Of H4.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The yeast SAS (something about silencing) protein complex contains a MYST-type putative acetyltransferase and functions with chromatin assembly factor ASF1. It Is Well Established That Acetylation Of Histone And Nonhistone Proteins Is Intimately Linked To Transcriptional Activation. However, Loss Of Acetyltransferase Activity Has Also Been Shown To Cause Silencing Defects, Implicating Acetylation In Gene Silencing. The Something About Silencing (Sas) 2 Protein Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, A Member Of The Myst (Moz, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, And Tip60) Acetyltransferase Family, Promotes Silencing At Hml And Telomeres. Here We Identify A ~450-Kd Sas Complex Containing Sas2P, Sas4P, And The Tf2F-Related Sas5 Protein. Mutations In The Conserved Acetyl-Coa Binding Motif Of Sas2P Are Shown To Disrupt The Ability Of Sas2P To Mediate The Silencing At Hml And Telomeres, Providing Evidence For An Important Role For The Acetyltransferase Activity Of The Sas Complex In Silencing. Furthermore, The Sas Complex Is Found To Interact With Chromatin Assembly Factor Asf1P, And Asf1 Mutants Show Silencing Defects Similar To Mutants In The Sas Complex. Thus, Asf1-Dependent Chromatin Assembly May Mediate The Role Of The Sas Complex In Silencing.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Identification of factors mediating the developmental regulation of the early acting -3.9 kb chicken lysozyme enhancer element. The Chicken Lysozyme Gene -3.9 Kb Enhancer Forms A Dnase I Hypersensitive Site (Dhs) Early In Macrophage Differentiation, But Not In More Primitive Multipotent Myeloid Precursor Cells. A Nucleosome Becomes Precisely Positioned Across The Enhancer In Parallel With Dhs Formation. In Transfection Assays, The 5'-Part Of The -3.9 Kb Element Has Ubiquitous Enhancer Activity. The 3'-Part Has No Stimulatory Activity, But Is Necessary For Enhancer Repression In Lysozyme Non-Expressing Cells. Recent Studies Have Shown That The Chromatin Fine Structure Of This Region Is Affected By Inhibition Of Histone Deacetylase Activity After Trichostatin A (Tsa) Treatment, But Only In Lysozyme Non-Expressing Cells. These Results Indicated A Developmental Modification Of Chromatin Structure From A Dynamic, But Inactive, To A Stabilised, Possibly Hyperacetylated, Active State. Here We Have Identified Positively And Negatively Acting Transcription Factors Binding To The -3.9 Kb Enhancer And Determined Their Contribution To Enhancer Activity. Furthermore, We Examined The Influence Of Tsa Treatment On Enhancer Activity In Macrophage Cells And Lysozyme Non-Expressing Cells, Including Multipotent Macrophage Precursors. Interestingly, Tsa Treatment Was Able To Restore Enhancer Activity Fully In Macrophage Precursor Cells, But Not In Non-Macrophage Lineage Cells. These Results Suggest (I) That The Transcription Factor Complement Of Multipotent Progenitor Cells Is Similar To That Of Lysozyme-Expressing Cells And (Ii) That Developmental Regulation Of The -3.9 Kb Enhancer Is Mediated By The Interplay Of Repressing And Activating Factors That Respond To Or Initiate Changes In The Chromatin Acetylation State.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Trithorax and dCBP acting in a complex to maintain expression of a homeotic gene. Trithorax (Trx) Is A Member Of The Trithorax Group (Trxg) Of Epigenetic Regulators, Which Is Required To Maintain Active States Of Hox Gene Expression During Development. We Have Purified From Drosophila Embryos A Trithorax Acetylation Complex (Tac1) That Contains Trx, Dcbp, And Sbf1. Like Cbp, Tac1 Acetylates Core Histones In Nucleosomes, Suggesting That This Activity May Be Important For Epigenetic Maintenance Of Gene Activity. Dcbp And Sbf1 Associate With Specific Sites On Salivary Gland Polytene Chromosomes, Colocalizing With Many Trx Binding Sites. One Of These Is The Site Of The Hox Gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx). Mutations In Either Trx Or The Gene Encoding Dcbp Reduce Expression Of The Endogenous Ubx Gene As Well As Of Transgenes Driven By The Bxd Regulatory Region Of Ubx. Thus Trx, Dcbp, And Sbf1 Are Closely Linked, Physically And Functionally, In The Maintenance Of Hox Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin-dependent cooperativity between constitutive and inducible activation domains in CREB. The Cyclic Amp (Camp)-Responsive Factor Creb Induces Target Gene Expression Via Constitutive (Q2) And Inducible (Kid, For Kinase-Inducible Domain) Activation Domains That Function Synergistically In Response To Cellular Signals. Kid Stimulates Transcription Via A Phospho (Ser133)-Dependent Interaction With The Coactivator Paralogs Creb Binding Protein And P300, Whereas Q2 Recruits The Tfiid Complex Via A Direct Association With Htaf(Ii)130. Here We Investigate The Mechanism Underlying Cooperativity Between The Q2 Domain And Kid In Creb By In Vitro Transcription Assay With Naked Dna And Chromatin Templates Containing The Camp-Responsive Somatostatin Promoter. The Q2 Domain Was Highly Active On A Naked Dna Template, And Ser133 Phosphorylation Had No Additional Effect On Transcriptional Initiation In Crude Extracts. Q2 Activity Was Repressed On A Chromatin Template, However, And This Repression Was Relieved By The Phospho (Ser133) Kid-Dependent Recruitment Of P300 Histone Acetyltransferase Activity To The Promoter. In Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays Of Nih 3T3 Cells, Camp-Dependent Recruitment Of P300 To The Somatostatin Promoter Stimulated Acetylation Of Histone H4. Correspondingly, Overexpression Of Htafii130 Potentiated Creb Activity In Cells Exposed To Camp, But Had No Effect On Reporter Gene Expression In Unstimulated Cells. We Propose That Cooperativity Between The Kid And Q2 Domains Proceeds Via A Chromatin-Dependent Mechanism In Which Recruitment Of P300 Facilitates Subsequent Interaction Of Creb With Tfiid.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The histone acetyltransferase activity of PCAF cooperates with the brahma/SWI2-related protein BRG-1 in the activation of the enhancer A of the MHC class I promoter. Major Histocompatibility Complex (Mhc) Class I Proteins Are An Essential Component Of The Immune System Allowing The Organism To Protect From Viral Infections And Neoplastic Transformation. Expression Of The Mhc Class I Genes Is Regulated By A Variety Of Cis-Regulatory Promoter Elements Among Which The Enhancer A Is Of Particular Importance. This Enhancer Is Synergistically Activated Through Ap-1/Atf And Nf-Kappa B Transcription Factors. Nf-Kappa B Recruits The Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) P300/Creb-Binding Protein (Cbp) To The Multiprotein Complex Bound To The Enhancer A. Here We Present Evidence That Acetylation And Deacetylation Processes Are Involved In The Activation Of The Enhancer A. The P300/Cbp Associated Factor Pcaf, But Not P300/Cbp, Counteracts The Repression Of The Enhancer A Mediated By The Histone Deacetylase Hdac1. Furthermore, Overexpression Of Pcaf Results In An Increase In The Acetylation Of Histone H4 Bound To The Enhancer A And Hdac1 Counteracts The Pcaf-Mediated H4 Acetylation. The Activation Function Of Pcaf Requires The P300/Cbp Binding Motif Indicating That Pcaf Might Be Recruited To The Enhancer A Through An Association With P300/Cbp. Moreover, Pcaf And The Brahma/Swi2-Related Protein Brg-1, Which Is A Key Factor Of The Human Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodelling Complex Swi/Snf, Synergistically Up-Regulate The Enhancer A. Synergistic Activation Requires The Hat Domain Of Pcaf. Taken Together Our Data Suggest That Members Of Two Different Groups Of Chromatin Modifying Complexes Are Involved In The Activation Of The Enhancer A Of The Mhc Class I Promoter.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Mitogen-regulated RSK2-CBP interaction controls their kinase and acetylase activities. The Protein Kinase Ribosomal S6 Kinase 2 (Rsk2) Has Been Implicated In Phosphorylation Of Transcription Factor Creb And Histone H3 In Response To Mitogenic Stimulation By Epidermal Growth Factor. Binding Of Phospho-Creb To The Coactivator Cbp Allows Gene Activation Through Recruitment Of The Basal Transcriptional Machinery. Acetylation Of H3 By Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Activities, Such As The One Carried By Cbp, Has Been Functionally Coupled To H3 Phosphorylation. While Various Lines Of Evidence Indicate That Coupled Histone Acetylation And Phosphorylation May Act In Concert To Induce Chromatin Remodeling Events Facilitating Gene Activation, Little Is Known About The Coupling Of The Two Processes At The Signaling Level. Here We Show That Cbp And Rsk2 Are Associated In A Complex In Quiescent Cells And That They Dissociate Within A Few Minutes Upon Mitogenic Stimulus. Cbp Preferentially Interacts With Unphosphorylated Rsk2 In A Complex Where Both Rsk2 Kinase Activity And Cbp Acetylase Activity Are Inhibited. Dissociation Is Dependent On Phosphorylation Of Rsk2 On Ser227 And Results In Stimulation Of Both Kinase And Hat Activities. We Propose A Model In Which Dynamic Formation And Dissociation Of The Cbp-Rsk2 Complex In Response To Mitogenic Stimulation Allow Regulated Phosphorylation And Acetylation Of Specific Substrates, Leading To Coordinated Modulation Of Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	p300/CBP proteins: HATs for transcriptional bridges and scaffolds. P300/Cbp Transcriptional Co-Activator Proteins Play A Central Role In Co-Ordinating And Integrating Multiple Signal-Dependent Events With The Transcription Apparatus, Allowing The Appropriate Level Of Gene Activity To Occur In Response To Diverse Physiological Cues That Influence, For Example, Proliferation, Differentiation And Apoptosis. P300/Cbp Activity Can Be Under Aberrant Control In Human Disease, Particularly In Cancer, Which May Inactivate A P300/Cbp Tumour-Suppressor-Like Activity. The Transcription Regulating-Properties Of P300 And Cbp Appear To Be Exerted Through Multiple Mechanisms. They Act As Protein Bridges, Thereby Connecting Different Sequence-Specific Transcription Factors To The Transcription Apparatus. Providing A Protein Scaffold Upon Which To Build A Multicomponent Transcriptional Regulatory Complex Is Likely To Be An Important Feature Of P300/Cbp Control. Another Key Property Is The Presence Of Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Activity, Which Endows P300/Cbp With The Capacity To Influence Chromatin Activity By Modulating Nucleosomal Histones. Other Proteins, Including The P53 Tumour Suppressor, Are Targets For Acetylation By P300/Cbp. With The Current Intense Level Of Research Activity, P300/Cbp Will Continue To Be In The Limelight And, We Can Be Confident, Yield New And Important Information On Fundamental Processes Involved In Transcriptional Control.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation beyond promoters: long-range acetylation patterns in the chromatin world. Histone Acetylation Is An Important Regulatory Mechanism That Controls Transcription And Diverse Nuclear Processes. While Great Progress Has Been Made In Understanding How Localized Acetylation And Deacetylation Control Promoter Activity, Virtually Nothing Is Known About The Consequences Of Acetylation Throughout Entire Chromosomal Regions. An Increasing Number Of Genes Have Been Found To Reside In Large Chromatin Domains That Are Controlled By Regulatory Elements Many Kilobases Away. Recent Studies Have Shown That Broad Histone Acetylation Patterns Are Hallmarks Of Chromatin Domains. The Purpose Of This Review Is To Discuss How Such Patterns Are Established And Their Implications For Regulating Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Promoter targeting of chromatin-modifying complexes. The Action Of Multi-Subunit Complexes That Are Able To Overcome The Repressive Effects Of Chromatin Is An Important Step In The Regulation Of Eukaryotic Gene Expression. Identification Of Complexes That Modify The Structure Of Chromatin To Help Factors Access The Underlying Dna Has Enhanced Our Understanding Of How Some Genes Are Controlled. Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) And Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Represent One Group Of Complexes That Regulate The Level Of Acetylation On The N-Terminal Tails Of Core Histone Proteins. The Swi/Snf Complex Is The Prototype Of A Second Group Of Complexes, Which Use The Energy Of Atp-Hydrolysis To Alter Histone-Dna Contacts, Leading To Changes In Chromatin Conformation. Genetic Studies In Yeast Have Revealed That Some Of These Multi-Subunit Complexes Interact In Vivo To Control Transcription Of A Subset Of Genes. It Has Become Apparent That Some Gene Promoters Require Modifications By Both Types Of Complexes. An Important Question Regarding These Two Types Of Complexes Is How They Are Recruited To The Promoters Of Genes That Are Dependent On Their Activity For Their Expression. This Review Will Tie Together Many Studies On Promoter Recruitment Of Both Hats And Swi/Snf. Emphasis Will Be Placed On Recent Data That Demonstrates Functional Interplay Between These Two Types Of Chromatin-Remodeling Activities. In Addition, This Review Summarizes Recent Data Demonstrating The Ability Of Repressors And Corepressors To Recruit Histone Deacetylase Complexes. Interestingly, Many Subunits Of Chromatin-Modifying Complexes In Humans Have Been Implicated In The Development Of Cancer. Thus, Studying How These Complexes Work Can Help Us Better Understand Human Diseases.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylation by histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein/p300 of STAT6 is required for transcriptional activation of the 15-lipoxygenase-1 gene. Interleukin-4 (Il-4) Induces Expression Of Reticulocyte-Type 15-Lipoxygenase-1 (15-Lox-1) In Various Mammalian Cells Via The Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 6 (Stat6) Signaling System. We Studied The Mechanism Of 15-Lox-1 Induction In A549 Lung Epithelial Cells And Found That Genistein, A Potent Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, Prevented Phopsphorylation Of Stat6, Its Binding To The 15-Lox-1 Promoter, And The Expression Of Catalytically Active Enzyme. In Contrast, Cycloheximide Did Not Prevent 15-Lox-1 Induction. Surprisingly, We Found That Il-4 Up-Regulated The Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Of Creb-Binding Protein (Cbp)/P300, Which Is Responsible For Acetylation Of Nuclear Histones And Stat6. The Acetylation Of Both Proteins Appears To Be Essential For The Il-4-Induced Signal Transduction Cascade, Because Inhibition Of Cbp/P300 By The Viral Wild-Type E1A Oncoprotein Abrogated Acetylation Of Both Histones And Stat6 And Strongly Suppressed Transcriptional Activation Of The 15-Lox-1 Gene. Moreover, We Found That The Inhibition By Sodium Butyrate Of Histone Deacetylases, Which Apparently Suppress 15-Lox-1 Gene Transcription, Synergistically Enhanced The Il-4-Stimulated 15-Lox-1 Expression. These Data Suggest That Both Phosphorylation And Acetylation Of Stat6 As Well As Acetylation Of Nuclear Histones Are Involved In Transcriptional Activation Of The 15-Lox-1 Gene, Although These Reactions Follow Differential Kinetics. Stat6 Phosphorylation Proceeds Within The First Hour Of Il-4 Stimulation. In Contrast, Cbp/P300-Mediated Acetylation Requires 9-11 H, And Similar Kinetics Were Observed For The Expression Of The Active Enzyme. Thus, Our Results Suggest That In The Absence Of Il-4, Nuclear Histones May Be Bound To Regulatory Elements Of The 15-Lox-1 Gene, Preventing Its Transcription. Il-4 Stimulation Causes Rapid Phosphorylation Of Stat6, But Its Binding To The Promoter Appears To Be Prevented By Nonacetylated Histones. After 9-11 H, When Histones Become Acetylated, Stat6 Binding Sites May Be Demasked So That The Phosphorylated And Acetylated Transcription Factor Can Bind To Activate Gene Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Snf1--a histone kinase that works in concert with the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 to regulate transcription. Modification Of Histones Is An Important Element In The Regulation Of Gene Expression. Previous Work Suggested A Link Between Acetylation And Phosphorylation, But Questioned Its Mechanistic Basis. We Have Purified A Histone H3 Serine-10 Kinase Complex From Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Have Identified Its Catalytic Subunit As Snf1. The Snf1/Ampk Family Of Kinases Function In Conserved Signal Transduction Pathways. Our Results Show That Snf1 And The Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Function In An Obligate Sequence To Enhance Ino1 Transcription By Modifying Histone H3 Serine-10 And Lysine-14. Thus, Phosphorylation And Acetylation Are Targeted To The Same Histone By Promoter-Specific Regulation By A Kinase/Acetyltransferase Pair, Supporting Models Of Gene Regulation Wherein Transcription Is Controlled By Coordinated Patterns Of Histone Modification.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A transient histone hyperacetylation signal marks nucleosomes for remodeling at the PHO8 promoter in vivo. Chromatin Remodeling Of The Yeast Pho8 Promoter Requires The Saga Histone Acetyltransferase Complex. We Report Here That Saga Is Necessary And Sufficient To Establish An Activator-Dependent Hyperacetylation Peak Over The Pho8 Promoter That Is Restricted To Those Nucleosomes That Are Remodeled Upon Activation. This Local Hyperacetylated State Is Observed Upon Activation In The Absence Of The Swi/Snf Complex When The Remodeling Process Is Frozen Subsequent To Activator Binding. Hyperacetylation Is Lost, However, If Remodeling Is Permitted To Go To Completion. Thus, A Transient Histone Hyperacetylation Signal Is Shown To Be A Prerequisite For, And Determinant Of, The Domain Of Nucleosome Remodeling In Vivo.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The maize WD-repeat gene ZmRbAp1 encodes a member of the MSI/RbAp sub-family and is differentially expressed during endosperm development. Members Of The Msi/Rbap Sub-Family Of Wd-Repeat Proteins Are Widespread In Eukaryotic Organisms And Form Part Of Multiprotein Complexes That Are Involved In Various Biological Pathways, Including Chromatin Assembly, Regulation Of Gene Transcription, And Cell Division. In This Study We Report The Isolation And Characterization Of A Cdna Sequence From Zea Mays, Which Encodes An Rbap-Like Protein (Zmrbap1) That Binds Acetylated Histones H3 And H4 And Suppresses Mutations That Have A Negative Effect On The Ras/Camp Pathway In Yeast. The Zmrbap Genes Form A Gene Family And Are Expressed In Different Tissues Of Z. Mays L. Plants. Determination Of Its Expression Pattern During Maize Seed Development Revealed That Zmrbap Transcripts Are Abundant During The Initial Stages Of Endosperm Formation. In Addition, The Transcripts Are Specifically Localized In Shoot Apical Meristem And Leaf Primordia Of The Embryo. A Possible Role For The Zmrbap Genes In Early Endosperm Differentiation And Plant Development Is Discussed.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Telomerase activation by histone deacetylase inhibitor in normal cells. Although Telomerase Activity Is Known To Be Regulated Mainly At The Level Of Transcription Of The Human Telomerase Catalytic Subunit (Htert) Gene, The Molecular Mechanism Underlying Tumor-Specific Expression Of Telomerase Remains Unclear. Emerging Evidence Suggests That Reversible Acetylation Of Nucleosomal Histones And The Resultant Changes In The Chromatin Structure Are Important Processes In Gene Transcription. In Particular, Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Inhibitors Activate The Transcription Of Certain Genes By Altering The Acetylation Status Of Nucleosomal Histones. The Present Study Examines The Effects Of Hdac Inhibitor On Htert Gene Transcription. Treatment With Tricostatin A (Tsa) Induced Significant Activation Of Htert Mrna Expression And Telomerase Activity In Normal Cells, But Not In Cancer Cells. Transient Expression Assays Revealed That Tsa Activates The Htert Promoter. Furthermore, The Proximal 181 Bp Core Promoter Of Htert, Which Contains Two C-Myc And Five Sp1 Sites, Was Determined To Be The Responsible Element. Overexpression Of Sp1 Enhanced Responsiveness To Tsa, And Mutation Of Sp1 Sites, But Not C-Myc Sites, Of The Core Promoter Of Htert Abrogated This Activation. Introduction Of The Dominant-Negative Form Of The Sp Family Inhibited Tsa Activation. These Results Indicate That Hdac Inhibitor Activates The Htert Promoter In Normal Cells, In Which Sp1 Plays A Key Role. This Finding Suggests One Way Whereby Histone Deacetylation May Be Involved In Silencing The Htert Gene In Normal Cells.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Emerging connections between DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Modifications Of Both Dna And Chromatin Can Affect Gene Expression And Lead To Gene Silencing. Evidence Of Links Between Dna Methylation And Histone Hypoacetylation Is Accumulating. Several Proteins That Specifically Bind To Methylated Dna Are Associated With Complexes That Include Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs). In Addition, Dna Methyltransferases Of Mammals Appear To Interact With Hdacs. Experiments With Animal Cells Have Shown That Hdacs Are Responsible For Part Of The Repressive Effect Of Dna Methylation. Evidence Was Found In Neurospora That Protein Acetylation Can In Some Cases Affect Dna Methylation. The Available Data Suggest That The Roles Of Dna Methylation And Histone Hypoacetylation, And Their Relationship With Each Other, Can Vary, Even Within An Organism. Some Open Questions In This Emerging Field That Should Be Answered In The Near Future Are Discussed.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Mammalian histone acetyltransferases and their complexes. One Of The Key Questions In The Current Molecular Genetics Of Eukaryotes Is How Genetic Information Is Retrieved From Tightly Packed Chromatin. Acetylation Of Core Histone N-Termini Is Implicated In The Regulation Of Chromatin Function, And I Summarize What Is Known About The Mammalian Enzymes That Promote This Posttranslational Histone Modification. Chromatin Is Important In Gene Expression Not Only Because Of The Accessibility Problem That It Poses For The Transcriptional Machinery But Also With Regard To The Phenomenon Of Chromatin Memory, I.E. The Ability Of Alternative Chromatin States To Be Maintained Through Many Cell Divisions. This Phenomenon Is Believed To Be Central To Epigenetic Inheritance, An Important Concept In Developmental Biology, Which Is Also Emerging As A Contributing Factor In Cancer And Other Health Disorders. Analyses Of The Composition Of Large Multiprotein Acetyltransferase Complexes Suggest Their Role In The Mechanisms Of Epigenetic Inheritance. The Review Will Discuss Some Models Pertinent To This Function Of Histone Acetyltransferases.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Yeast histone deposition protein Asf1p requires Hir proteins and PCNA for heterochromatic silencing. Position-Dependent Gene Silencing In Yeast Involves Many Factors, Including The Four Hir Genes And Nucleosome Assembly Proteins Asf1P And Chromatin Assembly Factor I (Caf-I, Encoded By The Cac1-3 Genes). Both Cac Delta Asfl Delta And Cac Delta Hir Delta Double Mutants Display Synergistic Reductions In Heterochromatic Gene Silencing. However, The Relationship Between The Contributions Of Hir Genes And Asf1 To Silencing Has Not Previously Been Explored.Our Biochemical And Genetic Studies Of Yeast Asf1P Revealed Links To Hir Protein Function. In Vitro, An Active Histone Deposition Complex Was Formed From Recombinant Yeast Asf1P And Histones H3 And H4 That Lack A Newly Synthesized Acetylation Pattern. This Asf1P/H3/H4 Complex Generated Micrococcal Nuclease--Resistant Dna In The Absence Of Dna Replication And Stimulated Nucleosome Assembly Activity By Recombinant Yeast Caf-I During Dna Synthesis. Also, Asf1P Bound To The Hir1P And Hir2P Proteins In Vitro And In Cell Extracts. In Vivo, The Hir1 And Asf1 Genes Contributed To Silencing The Heterochromatic Hml Locus Via The Same Genetic Pathway. Deletion Of Either Hir1 Or Asf1 Eliminated Telomeric Gene Silencing In Combination With Pol30--8, Encoding An Altered Form Of The Dna Polymerase Processivity Factor Pcna That Prevents Caf-I From Contributing To Silencing. Conversely, Other Pol30 Alleles Prevented Asf1/Hir Proteins From Contributing To Silencing.Yeast Caf-I And Asf1P Cooperate To Form Nucleosomes In Vitro. In Vivo, Asf1P And Hir Proteins Physically Interact And Together Promote Heterochromatic Gene Silencing In A Manner Requiring Pcna. This Asf1/Hir Silencing Pathway Functionally Overlaps With Caf-I Activity.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Silenced chromatin is permissive to activator binding and PIC recruitment. Chromatin Is Thought To Repress Transcription By Limiting Access Of The Dna To Transcription Factors. Using A Yeast Heat Shock Gene Flanked By Mating-Type Silencers As A Model System, We Find That Repressive, Sir-Generated Heterochromatin Is Permissive To The Constitutive Binding Of An Activator, Hsf, And Two Components Of The Preinitiation Complex (Pic), Tbp And Pol Ii. These Factors Cohabitate The Promoter With Sir Silencing Proteins And Deacetylated Nucleosomal Histones. The Heterochromatic Hmra1 Promoter Is Also Occupied By Tbp And Pol Ii, Suggesting That Sir Regulates Gene Expression Not By Restricting Factor Access To Dna But Rather By Blocking A Step Downstream Of Pic Recruitment. Interestingly, Activation Of Silent Promoter Chromatin Occurs In The Absence Of Histone Displacement And Without Change In Histone Acetylation State.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Coactivator p300 acetylates the interferon regulatory factor-2 in U937 cells following phorbol ester treatment. Interferon Regulatory Factor-2 (Irf-2) Is A Transcription Factor Of The Irf Family That Represses Interferon-Mediated Gene Expression. In The Present Study, We Show That Human Monocytic U937 Cells Express Truncated Forms Of Irf-2 Containing The Dna Binding Domain But Lacking Much Of The C-Terminal Regulatory Domain. U937 Cells Are Shown To Respond To Phorbol Ester 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-Acetate (Tpa) To Induce Expression Of Histone Acetylases P300 And P300/Cbp-Associated Factor (Pcaf). In Addition, Tpa Treatment Led To The Appearance Of Full-Length Irf-2, Along With A Reduction Of The Truncated Protein. Interestingly, Full-Length Irf-2 In Tpa-Treated U937 Cells Occurred As A Complex With P300 As Well As Pcaf And Was Itself Acetylated. Consistent With These Results, Recombinant Irf-2 Was Acetylated By P300 And To A Lesser Degree By Pcaf In Vitro. Another Irf Member, Irf-1, An Activator Of Interferon-Mediated Transcription, Was Also Acetylated In Vitro By These Acetylases. Finally, We Demonstrate That The Addition Of Irf-2 But Not Irf-1 Inhibits Core Histone Acetylation By P300 In Vitro. The Addition Of Irf-2 Also Inhibited Acetylation Of Nucleosomal Histones In Tpa-Treated U937 Cells. Acetylated Irf-2 May Affect Local Chromatin Structure In Vivo By Inhibiting Core Histone Acetylation And May Serve As A Mechanism By Which Irf-2 Negatively Regulates Interferon-Inducible Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. Chromatin Represents A Repressive Barrier To The Process Of Transcription. This Molecular Obstacle Is A Highly Dynamic Structure, Able To Compact The Dna Of The Entire Genome Into The Confines Of A Nucleus, And Yet It Allows Access To The Genetic Information Held Within. The Acetylation Of Histones Has Emerged As A Regulatory Mechanism Capable Of Modulating The Properties Of Chromatin And Thus The Competence Of The Dna Template For Transcriptional Activation. The Role Of Acetylation In Chromatin Remodeling Is Therefore Of Paramount Importance To Our Understanding Of Gene Regulation In Vivo.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Effects of histone acetylation on the equilibrium accessibility of nucleosomal DNA target sites. Posttranslational Acetylation Of The Conserved Core Histone N-Terminal Tail Domains Is Linked To Gene Activation, But The Molecular Mechanisms Involved Are Not Known. In An Earlier Study We Showed That Removing The Tail Domains Altogether By Trypsin Proteolysis (Which Leaves Nucleosomes Nevertheless Intact) Leads To 1.5 To 14-Fold Increases In The Dynamic Equilibrium Accessibility Of Nucleosomal Dna Target Sites. These Observations Suggested That, By Modestly Increasing The Equilibrium Accessibility Of Buried Dna Target Sites, Histone Acetylation Could Result In An Increased Occupancy By Regulatory Proteins, Ultimately Increasing The Probability Of Transcription Initiation. Here, We Extend These Observations To A More Natural System Involving Intact But Hyperacetylated Nucleosomes. We Find That Histone Hyperacetylation Leads To 1.1 To 1.8-Fold Increases In Position-Dependent Equilibrium Constants For Exposure Of Nucleosomal Dna Target Sites, With An Average Increase Of 1.4(+/-0.1)-Fold. The Mechanistic And Biological Implications Of These Results Are Discussed.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation and the cell-cycle in cancer. A Number Of Distinct Surveillance Systems Are Found In Mammalian Cells That Have The Capacity To Interrupt Normal Cell-Cycle Progression. These Are Referred To As Cell Cycle Check Points. Surveillance Systems Activated By Dna Damage Act At Three Stages, One At The G1/S Phase Boundary, One That Monitors Progression Through S Phase And One At The G2/M Boundary. The Initiation Of Dna Synthesis And Irrevocable Progression Through G1 Phase Represents An Additional Checkpoint When The Cell Commits To Dna Synthesis. Transition Through The Cell Cycle Is Regulated By A Family Of Protein Kinase Holoenzymes, The Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (Cdks), And Their Heterodimeric Cyclin Partner. Orderly Progression Through The Cell-Cycle Checkpoints Involves Coordinated Activation Of The Cdks That, In The Presence Of An Associated Cdk-Activating Kinase (Cak), Phosphorylate Target Substrates Including Members Of The "Pocket Protein" Family. One Of These, The Product Of The Retinoblastoma Susceptibility Gene (The Prb Protein), Is Phosphorylated Sequentially By Both Cyclin D/Cdk4 Complexes And Cyclin E/Cdk2 Kinases. Recent Studies Have Identified Important Cross Talk Between The Cell-Cycle Regulatory Apparatus And Proteins Regulating Histone Acetylation. Prb Binds Both E2F Proteins And Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Complexes. Hdac Plays An Important Role In Prb Tumor Suppression Function And Transcriptional Repression. Histones Are Required For Accurate Assembly Of Chromatin And The Induction Of Histone Gene Expression Is Tightly Coordinated. Recent Studies Have Identified An Important Alternate Substrate Of Cyclin E/Cdk2, Npat (Nuclear Protein Mapped To The Atm Locus) Which Plays A Critical Role In Promoting Cell-Cycle Progression In The Absence Of Prb, And Contributes To Cell-Cycle Regulated Histone Gene Expression. The Acetylation Of Histones By A Number Of Histone Acetyl Transferases (Hats) Also Plays An Important Role In Coordinating Gene Expression And Cell-Cycle Progression. Components Of The Cell-Cycle Regulatory Apparatus Are Both Regulated By Hats And Bind Directly To Hats. Finally Transcription Factors Have Been Identified As Substrate For Hats. Mutations Of These Transcription Factors At Their Sites Of Acetylation Has Been Associated With Constitutive Activity And Enhanced Cellular Proliferation, Suggesting An Important Role For Acetylation In Transcriptional Repression As Well As Activation. Together These Studies Provide A Working Model In Which The Cell-Cycle Regulatory Kinases Phosphorylate And Inactivate Hdacs, Coordinate Histone Gene Expression And Bind To Histone Acetylases Themselves. The Recent Evidence For Cross-Talk Between The Cyclin-Dependent Kinases And Histone Gene Expression On The One Hand And Cyclin-Dependent Regulation Of Histone Acetylases On The Other, Suggests Chemotherapeutics Targeting Histone Acetylation May Have Complex And Possibly Complementary Effects With Agents Targeting Cdks.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Participation of histones and histone-modifying enzymes in cell functions through alterations in chromatin structure. Alterations In The Chromatin Structure Are Preferentially Involved In The Regulation Of Cell Functions, Including Gene Expression, In Eukaryotes. Three Types Of Mechanisms, By Which The Alterations Are Caused Have Been Reported: (I) Variants Of Histone Subtypes, (Ii) Chromatin Remodeling, And (Iii) Post-Translational Modification. This Review Focuses Mainly On The First And Third Mechanisms, Especially On The Acetylation Of Core Histones, One Of The Third Mechanisms. Using The Gene Targeting Technique For The Dt40 Chicken B Cell Line, We Systematically Generated A Number Of Mutants, Respectively, Devoid Of Particular Genes Encoding Histones And Histone Deacetylase(S) (Hdacs). Most Of The H1 And Core Histone Variants Should Be Involved Positively Or Negatively In The Transcription Regulation Of Particular Genes. Of The Chicken Hdacs (Chhdacs), Chhdac-2 Controls The Amount Of The Igm H-Chain At The Steps Of Both Transcription And Alternative Pre-Mrna Processing, And Chhdac-3 Is Essential For Cell Viability, Whereas Chhdac-1 Merely Affects Gene Expression In Dt40 Cells. These Results Indicate That Hdac Family Members Should Participate, In Combination With One Another, And/Or Histone Acetyltransferase(S) (Hats), In The Acetylation Of Core Histones That Regulates Gene Expression Through Alterations In The Chromatin Structure.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Targeted histone acetylation and altered nuclease accessibility over short regions of the pea plastocyanin gene. The Chromatin Structure Of The Pea Plastocyanin Gene (Pete) Was Examined At Three Different Transcriptional States By Investigating The Acetylation States Of Histones H3 And H4 And The Nuclease Accessibility Of The Gene In Pea Roots, Etiolated Shoots, And Green Shoots. The Acetylation States Of Histones Associated With Different Regions Of Pete Were Analyzed By Chromatin Immunoprecipitation With Antibodies Specific For Acetylated Or Nonacetylated Histone H3 Or H4 Tails, Followed By Polymerase Chain Reaction Quantification. Comparison Of Pea Tissues Indicated That Histone Hyperacetylation Was Associated With Increased Pete Transcription In Green Shoots. Moreover, Hyperacetylation Of Both Histones H3 And H4 Was Targeted To The Enhancer/Promoter Region In Green Shoots, Suggesting That Only Specific Nucleosomes Along The Gene Were Modified. Time-Course Digestions Of Nuclei With Micrococcal Nuclease And Dnasei Indicated That The Enhancer/Promoter Region Was More Resistant To Digestion In The Inactive Gene In Pea Roots Than Was The Same Region In The Active Gene In Shoots, Whereas The Transcribed Region Of Pete Was Digested Similarly Among The Tissues. This Finding Indicates That Transcription Is Accompanied By Changes In The Nuclease Accessibility Of The Enhancer/Promoter Region Only. Moreover, These Results Indicate That The Changes In Nuclease Accessibility Are Organ Specific, Whereas Histone Hyperacetylation Is Light Dependent, And They Suggest That Changes In Nuclease Accessibility Precede Histone Hyperacetylation During Pete Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Mammalian histone acetyltransferase complexes. Over The Last Decade, Great Progress Has Been Made In Elucidating How The Human Genome Operates In The Chromatin Context. This Paper Describes Our Work On Two Human Acetyltransferases, Pcaf And Tip60, And Their Interaction Partners. This Study Provides New Clues On The Function Of These Enzymes. In A Striking Parallel With The General Transcription Factor Tfiid, Pcaf Complex Contains Proteins That Have Histone-Like Domains. We Speculate That These Subunits Can Presumably Form A Nucleosome-Like Structure On Dna, Which Would Allow Pcaf To Contribute To The Maintenance Of An Active State Of Chromatin. On The Other Hand, Tip60 Complex Contains Two Eukaryotic Homologs Of Bacterial Ruvb Helicase/Atpse, Involved In Recombination And Repair. Accordingly, Expression Of A Dominant Negative Mutant Of Tip60 In Living Cells Interferes With Their Ability To Repair Dna Damage, Which Points Out, For The First Time, A Role For A Histone Acetyltransferase In A Process Other Than Transcription. We Also Have Evidence Implicating Tip60 In The Apoptotic Response To Dna Damage.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation: lessons from the plant kingdom. Post-Translational Acetylation Of Core Histones Is An Enigmatic Process. The Identification Of Histone Acetyltransferases And Deacetylases As Co-Regulators Of Transcription In Yeast And Vertebrates Has Advanced Our Understanding Of The Biological Role Of Histone Acetylation And Also Improved Our General Insight Into The Molecular Network Of Gene Regulation. Basic Features Of Histone Acetylation In Plants Resemble Those Of Other Eukaryotes But There Are Differences, Which Are Reflected In Novel Classes Of Histone Deacetylase. Investigating Histone Acetylation In Higher Plants Might Reveal Regulatory Pathways Distinct From Animals, Yet Of Essential Importance For Gene Expression In Plants.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Regulation of histone acetylation and transcription by INHAT, a human cellular complex containing the set oncoprotein. Acetylation Of Histones By P300/Cbp And Pcaf Is Considered To Be A Critical Step In Transcriptional Regulation. In Order To Understand The Role Of Cellular Activities That Modulate Histone Acetylation And Transcription, We Have Purified And Characterized A Multiprotein Cellular Complex That Potently Inhibits The Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Of P300/Cbp And Pcaf. We Have Mapped A Novel Acetyltransferase-Inhibitory Domain Of This Inhat (Inhibitor Of Acetyltransferases) Complex That Binds To Histones And Masks Them From Being Acetyltransferase Substrates. Endogenous Inhat Subunits, Which Include The Set/Taf-Ibeta Oncoprotein, Associate With Chromatin In Vivo And Can Block Coactivatormediated Transcription When Transfected In Cells. We Propose That Histone Masking By Inhat Plays A Regulatory Role In Chromatin Modification And Serves As A Novel Mechanism Of Transcriptional Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Gcn4 activator targets Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase to specific promoters independently of transcription. Histone Acetylation Correlates Well With Transcriptional Activity, And Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) Selectively Regulate Subsets Of Target Genes By Mechanisms That Remain Unclear. Here, We Provide In Vivo Evidence That The Yeast Transcriptional Activator Gcn4 Recruits Gcn5 Hat Complexes To Selective Promoters Positioned In Natural Or Ectopic Locations, Thereby Creating Local Domains Of Histone H3 Hyperacetylation And Subsequent Transcriptional Activation. A Significant Portion Of The Gcn4-Targeted Histone Acetylation By Gcn5 Is Independent Of Transcriptional Activity. These Observations Provide Strong Evidence For Promoter-Selective, Targeted Histone Acetylation By Gcn5 That Facilitates Transcription In A Causal Fashion. In Addition, Gcn5 Also Functions In An Untargeted Manner To Acetylate H3 On A Genome-Wide Scale.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Coordinate regulation of yeast ribosomal protein genes is associated with targeted recruitment of Esa1 histone acetylase. The Esa1-Containing Nua4 Histone Acetylase Complex Can Interact With Activation Domains In Vitro And Stimulate Transcription On Reconstituted Chromatin Templates. In Yeast Cells, Esa1 Is Targeted To A Small Subset Of Promoters In An Activator-Specific Manner. Esa1 Is Specifically Recruited To Ribosomal Protein (Rp) Promoters, And This Recruitment Appears To Require Binding By Rap1 Or Abf1. Esa1 Is Important For Rp Transcription, And Esa1 Recruitment To Rp Promoters Correlates With Coordinate Regulation Of Rp Genes In Response To Growth Stimuli. However, Following Esa1 Depletion, H4 Acetylation Decreases Dramatically At Many Loci, But Transcription Is Not Generally Affected. Therefore, The Transcription-Associated Targeted Recruitment Of Esa1 To Rp Promoters Occurs In A Background Of More Global Nontargeted Acetylation That Is Itself Not Required For Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Global histone acetylation and deacetylation in yeast. Histone Acetyltransferases And Deacetylases Can Be Targeted To Promoters To Activate Or Repress Genes. For Example, The Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Is Part Of A Yeast Multiprotein Complex That Is Recruited By The Dna-Binding Activator Protein Gcn4 (Refs 1-3). The Histone Deacetylase Rpd3 Complex Is Recruited To Dna By The Repressor Ume6 (Refs 4, 5); Similar Mechanisms Exist In Other Eukaryotes. However, Deletion Of Rpd3 Also Increases Expression Of The Pho5 Gene That Is Repressed By Nucleosomes, And Regulated By Gcn5 (Ref. 10) But Not By Ume6. We Have Determined Whether Acetylation And Deacetylation Are Promoter Specific At Pho5, By Using Antibodies Against Acetylated Lysine Residues And Chromatin Immunoprecipitation To Examine The Acetylation State Of A 4.25-Kilobase Region Surrounding The Pho5 Gene. Here We Show That This Region Is Acetylated Extensively By Esa1 And Gcn5 And Deacetylated By Hda1 And Rpd3, And That Widespread Histone Modification Affects Three Separate Chromosomal Regions Examined, Which Total 22Kb. Our Data Indicate That Targeted Modification Occurs In A Background Of Global Acetylation And Deacetylation That Not Only Reduces Basal Transcription, But Also Allows A Rapid Return To The Initial State Of Acetylation When Targeting Is Removed.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Role of histone acetylation in the assembly and modulation of chromatin structures. The Acetylation Of The Core Histone N-Terminal "Tail" Domains Is Now Recognized As A Highly Conserved Mechanism For Regulating Chromatin Functional States. The Following Article Examines Possible Roles Of Acetylation In Two Critically Important Cellular Processes: Replication-Coupled Nucleosome Assembly, And Reversible Transitions In Chromatin Higher Order Structure. After A Description Of The Acetylation Of Newly Synthesized Histones, And Of The Likely Acetyltransferases Involved, An Overview Of Histone Octamer Assembly Is Presented. Our Current Understanding Of The Factors Thought To Assemble Chromatin In Vivo Is Then Described. Genetic And Biochemical Investigations Of The Function The Histone Tails, And Their Acetylation, In Nucleosome Assembly Are Detailed, Followed By An Analysis Of The Importance Of Histone Deacetylation In The Maturation Of Newly Replicated Chromatin. In The Final Section The Involvement Of The Histone Tail Domains In Chromatin Higher Order Structures Is Addressed, Along With The Role Of Histone Acetylation In Chromatin Folding. Suggestions For Future Research Are Offered In The Concluding Remarks.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromosomal localization links the SIN3-RPD3 complex to the regulation of chromatin condensation, histone acetylation and gene expression. Acetylation Of Core Histone N-Terminal Tails Influences Chromatin Condensation And Transcription. To Examine How The Sin3-Rpd3 Deacetylase Complex Contributes To These Events In Vivo, We Examined Binding Of Sin3 And Rpd3 To Drosophila Salivary Gland Polytene Chromosomes. The Binding Patterns Of Sin3 And Rpd3 Were Highly Coincident, Suggesting That The Sin3-Rpd3 Complex Is The Most Abundant Chromatin-Bound Rpd3 Complex In Salivary Gland Cells. Sin3- Rpd3 Binding Was Restricted To Less Condensed, Hypoacetylated Euchromatic Interbands And Was Absent From Moderately Condensed, Hyperacetylated Euchromatic Bands And Highly Condensed, Differentially Acetylated Centric Heterochromatin. Consistent With Its Demonstrated Role In Transcriptional Repression, Sin3-Rpd3 Did Not Co-Localize With Rna Polymer Ase Ii. Chromatin Binding Of The Complex, Mediated By Smrter, Decreased Upon Ecdysone-Induced Transcriptional Activation But Was Restored When Transcription Was Reduced. These Results Implicate Sin3-Rpd3 In Maintaining Histone Acetylation Levels Or Patterns Within Less Condensed Chromatin Domains And Suggest That Sin3-Rpd3 Activity Is Required, In The Absence Of An Activation Signal, To Repress Transcription Of Particular Genes Within Transcriptionally Active Chromatin Domains.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Targeted chromatin binding and histone acetylation in vivo by thyroid hormone receptor during amphibian development. Amphibian Metamorphosis Is Marked By Dramatic, Thyroid Hormone (Th)-Induced Changes Involving Gene Regulation By Th Receptor (Tr). It Has Been Postulated That Tr-Mediated Gene Regulation Involves Chromatin Remodeling. In The Absence Of Ligand, Tr Can Repress Gene Expression By Recruiting A Histone Deacetylase Complex, Whereas Liganded Tr Recruits A Histone Acetylase Complex For Gene Activation. Earlier Studies Have Led Us To Propose A Dual Function Model For Tr During Development. In Premetamorphic Tadpoles, Unliganded Tr Represses Transcription Involving Histone Deacetylation. During Metamorphosis, Endogenous Th Allows Tr To Activate Gene Expression Through Histone Acetylation. Here Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay, We Directly Demonstrate Tr Binding To Th Response Genes Constitutively In Vivo In Premetamorphic Tadpoles. We Further Show That Th Treatment Leads To Histone Deacetylase Release From Th Response Gene Promoters. Interestingly, In Whole Animals, Changes In Histone Acetylation Show Little Correlation With The Expression Of Th Response Genes. On The Other Hand, In The Intestine And Tail, Where Th Response Genes Are Known To Be Up-Regulated More Dramatically By Th Than In Most Other Organs, We Demonstrate That Th Treatment Induces Gene Activation And Histone H4 Acetylation. These Data Argue For A Role Of Histone Acetylation In Transcriptional Regulation By Trs During Amphibian Development In Some Tissues, Whereas In Others Changes In Histone Acetylation Levels May Play No Or Only A Minor Role, Supporting The Existence Of Important Alternative Mechanisms In Gene Regulation By Tr.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Ssn6-Tup1 interacts with class I histone deacetylases required for repression. Ssn6-Tup1 Regulates Multiple Genes In Yeast, Providing A Paradigm For Corepressor Functions. Tup1 Interacts Directly With Histones H3 And H4, And Mutation Of These Histones Synergistically Compromises Ssn6-Tup1-Mediated Repression. In Vitro, Tup1 Interacts Preferentially With Underacetylated Isoforms Of H3 And H4, Suggesting That Histone Acetylation May Modulate Tup1 Functions In Vivo. Here We Report That Histone Hyperacetylation Caused By Combined Mutations In Genes Encoding The Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Rpd3, Hos1, And Hos2 Abolishes Ssn6-Tup1 Repression. Unlike Hdac Mutations That Do Not Affect Repression, This Combination Of Mutations Causes Concomitant Hyperacetylation Of Both H3 And H4. Strikingly, Two Of These Class I Hdacs Interact Physically With Ssn6-Tup1. These Findings Suggest That Ssn6-Tup1 Actively Recruits Deacetylase Activities To Deacetylate Adjacent Nucleosomes And Promote Tup1-Histone Interactions.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation modifiers in the pathogenesis of malignant disease. Chromatin Structure Is Gaining Increasing Attention As A Potential Target In The Treatment Of Cancer. Relaxation Of The Chromatin Fiber Facilitates Transcription And Is Regulated By Two Competing Enzymatic Activities, Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) And Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs), Which Modify The Acetylation State Of Histone Proteins And Other Promoter-Bound Transcription Factors. While Hats, Which Are Frequently Part Of Multisubunit Coactivator Complexes, Lead To The Relaxation Of Chromatin Structure And Transcriptional Activation, Hdacs Tend To Associate With Multisubunit Core-Pressor Complexes, Which Result In Chromatin Condensation And Transcriptional Repression Of Specific Target Genes. Hats And Hdacs Are Known To Be Involved Both In The Pathogenesis As Well As In The Suppression Of Cancer. Some Of The Genes Encoding These Enzymes Have Been Shown To Be Rearranged In The Context Of Chromosomal Translocations In Human Acute Leukemias And Solid Tumors, Where Fusions Of Regulatory And Coding Regions Of A Variety Of Transcription Factor Genes Result In Completely New Gene Products That May Interfere With Regulatory Cascades Controlling Cell Growth And Differentiation. On The Other Hand, Some Histone Acetylation-Modifying Enzymes Have Been Located Within Chromosomal Regions That Are Particularly Prone To Chromosomal Breaks. In These Cases Gains And Losses Of Chromosomal Material May Affect The Availability Of Functionally Active Hats And Hdacs, Which In Turn Disturbs The Tightly Controlled Equilibrium Of Histone Acetylation. We Review Herein The Recent Achievements, Which Further Help To Elucidate The Biological Role Of Histone Acetylation Modifying Enzymes And Their Potential Impact On Our Current Understanding Of The Molecular Changes Involved In The Development Of Solid Tumors And Leukemias.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Regulation of gene expression by transcription factor acetylation. In The Nucleus, Dna Is Tightly Packaged Into Higher-Order Structures, Generating An Environment That Is Highly Repressive Towards Dna Processes Such As Gene Transcription. Acetylation Of Lysine Residues Within Proteins Has Recently Emerged As A Major Mechanism Used By The Cell To Overcome This Repression. Acetylation Of Non-Histone Proteins, Including Transcription Factors, As Well As Histones, Appears To Be Involved In This Process. Like Phosphorylation, Acetylation Is A Dynamic Process That Can Regulate Protein-Dna And Protein-Protein Interactions. Moreover, A Conserved Domain, The Bromodomain, Has Been Implicated In The Binding Of Acetylated Peptides, Suggesting A Role For Acetylation In Intracellular Signalling.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Activation of the BRLF1 promoter and lytic cycle of Epstein-Barr virus by histone acetylation. Histone Acetylation Alters The Chromatin Structure And Activates The Genes That Are Repressed By Histone Deacetylation. This Investigation Demonstrates That Treating P3Hr1 Cells With Trichostatin A (Tsa) Activates The Epstein-Barr Virus (Ebv) Lytic Cycle, Allowing The Virus To Synthesize Three Viral Lytic Proteins-Rta, Zta And Ea-D. Experimental Results Indicate That Tsa And 12-O:-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-Acetate Synergistically Activate The Transcription Of Brlf1, An Immediate-Early Gene Of Ebv. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Reveals That Histone H4 At The Brlf1 Promoter Is Acetylated After P3Hr1 Cells Are Treated With Tsa, Suggesting That Histone Acetylation Activates Brlf1 Transcription. Furthermore, Results In This Study Demonstrate That Mutation Of A Yy1-Binding Site In The Brlf1 Promoter Activates Brlf1 Transcription 1.6- And 2.3-Fold In P3Hr1 Cells And C33A Cells, Respectively. Real Time Pcr Analysis Reveals That The Mutation Also Increases The Histone Acetylation Level Of The Nucleosomes At The Brlf1 Promoter 1. 64- And 3.08-Fold In P3Hr1 And C33A Cells, Respectively. Results Presented Herein Suggest That Histone Deacetylation Plays An Important Role In Maintaining The Viral Latency And Histone Acetylation At The Brlf1 Promoter Allows The Virus To Express Rta And To Activate The Viral Lytic Cycle.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Multiple actin-related proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are present in the nucleus. An Increasing Number Of Actin-Related Proteins (Arps), Which Share The Basal Structure With Skeletal Actin But Possess Distinct Functions, Have Been Found In A Wide Variety Of Organisms. Individual Arps Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Were Classified Into Arps 1-10 Based On The Relatedness Of Their Sequences And Functions, Where Arp1 Is The Most Similar To Actin, And Arp10 Is The Least Similar. While Arps 1-3 And Their Orthologs In Other Organisms Are Localized Exclusively In The Cytoplasm, Arp4 (Also Known As Act3) Is Localized In The Nucleus And Is Involved In Transcriptional Regulation. Here We Examined The More Divergent Arps For Possible Nuclear Functions. We Show That Arps 5-9 Are Localized In The Nucleus, But Arp10 Is Not. The Nuclear Export Signals Identified In Actin Are Well Conserved In The Cytoplasmic Arps, Arps 1-3, But Less Conserved In The Nuclear Arps. Gel Filtration Chromatography Experiments Show That The Nuclear Arps Are Larger Than Monomer In Size And Thus Are Present In Multi-Protein Complexes. Since Nuclear Protein Complexes Containing Arps Are Found To Be Responsible For Histone Acetylation And Chromatin Remodeling, It Is Suggested That Most Of The Divergent Arps Are Involved In The !Transcriptional Regulation Through Chromatin Modulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Global role for chromatin remodeling enzymes in mitotic gene expression. Regulation Of Eukaryotic Gene Expression Requires Atp-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Enzymes, Such As Swi/Snf, And Histone Acetyltransferases, Such As Gcn5P. Here We Show That Swi/Snf Remodeling Controls Recruitment Of Gcn5P Hat Activity To Many Genes In Late Mitosis And That These Chromatin Remodeling Enzymes Play A Role In Regulating Mitotic Exit. In Contrast, Interphase Expression Of Gal1, His3, Pho5, And Pho8 Is Accompanied By Swi/Snf-Independent Recruitment Of Gcn5P Hat Activity. Surprisingly, Prearresting Cells In Late Mitosis Imposes A Requirement For Swi/Snf In Recruiting Gcn5P Hat Activity To The Gal1 Promoter, And Gal1 Expression Also Becomes Dependent On Both Chromatin Remodeling Enzymes. We Propose That Swi/Snf And Gcn5P Are Globally Required For Mitotic Gene Expression Due To The Condensed State Of Mitotic Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Type B histone acetyltransferase Hat1p participates in telomeric silencing. Hat1P And Hat2P Are The Two Subunits Of A Type B Histone Acetyltransferase From Saccharomyces Cerevisiae That Acetylates Free Histone H4 On Lysine 12 In Vitro. However, The Role For These Gene Products In Chromatin Function Has Been Unclear, As Deletions Of The Hat1 And/Or Hat2 Gene Displayed No Obvious Phenotype. We Have Now Identified A Role For Hat1P And Hat2P In Telomeric Silencing. Telomeric Silencing Is The Transcriptional Repression Of Telomere-Proximal Genes And Is Mediated By A Special Chromatin Structure. While There Was No Change In The Level Of Silencing On A Telomeric Gene When The Hat1 Or Hat2 Gene Was Deleted, A Significant Silencing Defect Was Observed When Hat1Delta Or Hat2Delta Was Combined With Mutations Of The Histone H3 Nh(2)-Terminal Tail. Specifically, When At Least Two Lysine Residues Were Changed To Arginine In The Histone H3 Tail, A Hat1Delta-Dependent Telomeric Silencing Defect Was Observed. The Most Dramatic Effects Were Seen When One Of The Two Changes Was In Lysine 14. In Further Analysis, We Found That A Single Lysine Out Of The Five In The Histone H3 Tail Was Sufficient To Mediate Silencing. However, K14 Was The Best At Preserving Silencing, Followed By K23 And Then K27; K9 And K18 Alone Were Insufficient. Mutational Analysis Of The Histone H4 Tail Indicated That The Role Of Hat1P In Telomeric Silencing Was Mediated Solely Through Lysine 12. Thus, In Contrast To Other Histone Acetyltransferases, Hat1P Activity Was Required For Transcriptional Repression Rather Than Gene Activation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Recruitment of chromatin remodelling factors during gene activation via the glucocorticoid receptor N-terminal domain. We Have Shown That Yeast Mutants With Defects In The Ada Adaptor Proteins Are Defective In Hormone-Dependent Gene Activation By Ectopically Expressed Human Glucocorticoid Receptor (Gr). Others Have Shown That The Ada2 Protein Is Required For Physical Interactions Between Some Activation Domains And Tbp (Tata-Binding Protein), Whereas The Gcn5 (Ada4) Protein Has A Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Activity. Although All Hat Enzymes Are Able To Acetylate Histone Substrates, Some Also Acetylate Non-Histone Proteins. Taken Together, These Observations Suggest That The Ada Proteins Have The Ability To Effect Different Steps In The Process Of Gene Activation. It Has Recently Been Shown That The Ada Proteins Are Present In Two Distinct Protein Complexes, The Ada Complex And A Larger Saga Complex. Our Recent Work Has Focused On Determining (1) Which Of The Ada-Containing Complexes Mediates Gene Activation By Gr, (2) Whether The Hat Activity Encoded By Gcn5 Is Required For Gr-Dependent Gene Activation, (3) Whether The Ada Proteins Contribute To Gr-Mediated Activation At The Level Of Chromatin Remodelling And (4) How The Role Of These Hat Complexes Is Integrated With Other Chromatin Remodelling Activities During Gr-Mediated Gene Activation. Our Results Suggest A Model In Which Gr Recruits The Saga Complex And That This Contributes To Chromatin Remodelling Via A Mechanism Involving The Acetylation Of Histones. Furthermore, Recruitment Of The Swi/Snf Remodelling Complex Also Has A Role In Gr-Mediated Activation That Is Independent Of The Role Of Saga. These Complexes Are Similar To Analogous Mammalian Complexes And Therefore These Results Are Likely To Be Relevant To The Human System.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone deacetylase inhibitors: inducers of differentiation or apoptosis of transformed cells. Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Inhibitors Have Been Shown To Be Potent Inducers Of Growth Arrest, Differentiation, And/Or Apoptotic Cell Death Of Transformed Cells In Vitro And In Vivo. One Class Of Hdac Inhibitors, Hydroxamic Acid-Based Hybrid Polar Compounds (Hpcs), Induce Differentiation At Micromolar Or Lower Concentrations. Studies (X-Ray Crystallographic) Showed That The Catalytic Site Of Hdac Has A Tubular Structure With A Zinc Atom At Its Base And That These Hdac Inhibitors, Such As Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid And Trichostatin A, Fit Into This Structure With The Hydroxamic Moiety Of The Inhibitor Binding To The Zinc. Hdac Inhibitors Cause Acetylated Histones To Accumulate In Both Tumor And Normal Tissues, And This Accumulation Can Be Used As A Marker Of The Biologic Activity Of The Hdac Inhibitors. Hydroxamic Acid-Based Hpcs Act Selectively To Inhibit Tumor Cell Growth At Levels That Have Little Or No Toxicity For Normal Cells. These Compounds Also Act Selectively On Gene Expression, Altering The Expression Of Only About 2% Of The Genes Expressed In Cultured Tumor Cells. In General, Chromatin Fractions Enriched In Actively Transcribed Genes Are Also Enriched In Highly Acetylated Core Histones, Whereas Silent Genes Are Associated With Nucleosomes With A Low Level Of Acetylation. However, Hdacs Can Also Acetylate Proteins Other Than Histones In Nucleosomes. The Role That These Other Targets Play In The Induction Of Cell Growth Arrest, Differentiation, And/Or Apoptotic Cell Death Has Not Been Determined. Our Working Hypothesis Is That Inhibition Of Hdac Activity Leads To The Modulation Of Expression Of A Specific Set Of Genes That, In Turn, Result In Growth Arrest, Differentiation, And/Or Apoptotic Cell Death. The Hydroxamic Acid-Based Hpcs Are Potentially Effective Agents For Cancer Therapy And, Possibly, Cancer Chemoprevention.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Synergistic coupling of histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. Histone Acetylation And Phosphorylation Have Separately Been Suggested To Affect Chromatin Structure And Gene Expression. Here We Report That These Two Modifications Are Synergistic. Stimulation Of Mammalian Cells By Epidermal Growth Factor (Egf) Results In Rapid And Sequential Phosphorylation And Acetylation Of H3, And These Dimodified H3 Molecules Are Preferentially Associated With The Egf-Activated C-Fos Promoter In A Map Kinase-Dependent Manner. In Addition, The Prototypical Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Displays An Up To 10-Fold Preference For Phosphorylated (Ser-10) H3 Over Nonphosphorylated H3 As Substrate In Vitro, Suggesting That H3 Phosphorylation Can Affect The Efficiency Of Subsequent Acetylation Reactions. Together, These Results Illustrate How The Addition Of Multiple Histone Modifications May Be Coupled During The Process Of Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Multiple histone acetyltransferases are associated with a chicken erythrocyte chromatin fraction enriched in active genes. We Have Examined Salt-Soluble Chromatin Released By Micrococcal Nuclease From A 15-Day-Old Chicken Embryo Erythrocyte Nuclei For Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Activities. This Chromatin Is Enriched In Transcriptionally Active Sequences From Within The Active Beta-Globin Locus And Contains Elevated Levels Of Acetylated Core Histones. Hat Activities Present In This Fraction Target Histones H4, H3, And H2A When The Chromatin Itself Is Used As The Substrate. In Gel Hat Activity Assay Demonstrates That The Salt-Soluble Chromatin Fraction Contains Four Acetyltransferase Molecules Distinguished By Their Different Molecular Masses (47, 33, 32, And 28 Kda). Further Separation Of The Chromatin By Centrifugation Through Sucrose Gradients Shows That The Acetyltransferases Segregate Into Chromatin-Bound And Chromatin-Free Populations. The 32- And 28-Kda Hats Are Associated With Chromatin, Whereas The 47- And 33-Kda Hat Molecules Are Not. The Chromatin-Bound Hat Activities Predominantly Target H4 To Give The Diacetyl And Triacetyl Species; Some Acetylation Of H2A Can Also Be Seen. Our Results Suggest That The Chromatin-Associated Acetyltransferases Have A Role In Gene Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Modulation of histone acetyltransferase activity through interaction of epstein-barr nuclear antigen 3C with prothymosin alpha. The Epstein-Barr Virus (Ebv) Nuclear Antigen 3C (Ebna3C) Is Essential For Ebv-Dependent Immortalization Of Human Primary B Lymphocytes. Genetic Analysis Indicated That Amino Acids 365 To 992 Are Important For Ebv-Mediated Immortalization Of B Lymphocytes. We Demonstrate That This Region Of Ebna3C Critical For Immortalization Interacts With Prothymosin Alpha (Protalpha), A Cellular Protein Previously Identified To Be Important For Cell Division And Proliferation. This Interaction Maps To A Region Downstream Of Amino Acid 365 Known To Be Involved In Transcription Regulation And Critical For Ebv-Mediated Transformation Of Primary B Lymphocytes. Additionally, We Show That Ebna3C Also Interacts With P300, A Cellular Acetyltransferase. This Interaction Suggests A Possible Role In Regulation Of Histone Acetylation And Chromatin Remodeling. An Increase In Histone Acetylation Was Observed In Ebv-Transformed Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines, Which Is Consistent With Increased Cellular Gene Expression. These Cells Express The Entire Repertoire Of Latent Nuclear Antigens, Including Ebna3C. Expression Of Ebna3C In Cells With Increased Acetyltransferase Activity Mediated By The Ebv Transactivator Ebna2 Results In Down-Modulation Of This Activity In A Dose-Responsive Manner. The Interactions Of Ebna3C With Protalpha And P300 Provide New Evidence Implicating This Essential Ebv Protein Ebna3C In Modulating The Acetylation Of Cellular Factors, Including Histones. Hence, Ebna3C Plays A Critical Role In Balancing Cellular Transcriptional Events By Linking The Biological Property Of Mediating Inhibition Of Ebna2 Transcription Activation And The Observed Histone Acetyltransferase Activity, Thereby Orchestrating Immortalization Of Ebv-Infected Cells.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Activation of transcription through histone H4 acetylation by MOF, an acetyltransferase essential for dosage compensation in Drosophila. Dosage Compensation In Drosophila Involves A 2-Fold Increase In Transcription From The Single Male X Relative To The Two Female X Chromosomes. Regulation At The Level Of The Chromosome Involves Alterations In Chromatin Organization: Male X Chromosomes Appear Decondensed And Are Marked By Acetylation Of Histone H4 At Lysine 16. We Demonstrate That Mof, A Protein Required For Dosage Compensation With Significant Sequence Similarity To The Myst Family Of Acetyltransferases, Is A Histone Acetyltransferase That Acetylates Chromatin Specifically At Histone H4 Lysine 16. This Acetylation Relieves Chromatin-Mediated Repression Of Transcription In Vitro And In Vivo If Mof Is Targeted To A Promoter By Fusion To A Dna-Binding Domain. Acetylation Of Chromatin By Mof, Therefore, Appears To Be Causally Involved In Transcriptional Activation During Dosage Compensation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylation of histones and transcription-related factors. The State Of Chromatin (The Packaging Of Dna In Eukaryotes) Has Long Been Recognized To Have Major Effects On Levels Of Gene Expression, And Numerous Chromatin-Altering Strategies-Including Atp-Dependent Remodeling And Histone Modification-Are Employed In The Cell To Bring About Transcriptional Regulation. Of These, Histone Acetylation Is One Of The Best Characterized, As Recent Years Have Seen The Identification And Further Study Of Many Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Proteins And Their Associated Complexes. Interestingly, Most Of These Proteins Were Previously Shown To Have Coactivator Or Other Transcription-Related Functions. Confirmed And Putative Hat Proteins Have Been Identified From Various Organisms From Yeast To Humans, And They Include Gcn5-Related N-Acetyltransferase (Gnat) Superfamily Members Gcn5, Pcaf, Elp3, Hpa2, And Hat1: Myst Proteins Sas2, Sas3, Esa1, Mof, Tip60, Moz, Morf, And Hbo1; Global Coactivators P300 And Creb-Binding Protein; Nuclear Receptor Coactivators Src-1, Actr, And Tif2; Tata-Binding Protein-Associated Factor Taf(Ii)250 And Its Homologs; And Subunits Of Rna Polymerase Iii General Factor Tfiiic. The Acetylation And Transcriptional Functions Of These Hats And The Native Complexes Containing Them (Such As Yeast Saga, Nua4, And Possibly Analogous Human Complexes) Are Discussed. In Addition, Some Of These Hats Are Also Known To Modify Certain Nonhistone Transcription-Related Proteins, Including High-Mobility-Group Chromatin Proteins, Activators Such As P53, Coactivators, And General Factors. Thus, We Also Detail These Known Factor Acetyltransferase (Fat) Substrates And The Demonstrated Or Potential Roles Of Their Acetylation In Transcriptional Processes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Targeted recruitment of histone acetyltransferase activity to a locus control region. Locus Control Regions (Lcrs) Are Capable Of Activating Target Genes Over Substantial Distances And Establishing Autonomously Regulated Chromatin Domains. The Basis For This Action Is Poorly Defined. Human Growth Hormone Gene (Hgh-N) Expression Is Activated By An Lcr Marked By A Series Of Dnase I-Hypersensitive Sites (Hsi-Iii And Hsv) In Pituitary Chromatin. These Hss Are Located Between -15 And -32 Kilobases (Kb) Relative To The Hgh Transcription Start Site. To Establish A Mechanistic Basis For Hgh Lcr Function, We Carried Out Acetylation Mapping Of Core Histones H3 And H4 In Chromatin Encompassing The Hgh Cluster. These Studies Revealed That The Entire Lcr Was Selectively Enriched For Acetylation In Chromatin Isolated From A Human Pituitary Somatotrope Adenoma And In Pituitaries Of Mice Transgenic For The Hgh Locus, But Not In Hepatic Or Erythroid Cells. Quantification Of Histone Modification In The Pituitary Revealed A Dramatic Peak At Hsi/Ii, The Major Pituitary-Specific Hgh Lcr Determinant (-15 Kb), With Gradually Decreasing Levels Of Modification Extending From This Site In Both 5'- And 3'-Directions. The 5'-Border Of The Acetylated Domain Coincided With The 5' Most Hgh Lcr Element, Hsv (-34 Kb); And The 3'-Border Included The Expressed Hgh-N Gene, But Did Not Extend Farther 3' Into The Placenta-Specific Region Of The Gene Cluster. These Data Support A Model Of Lcr Function Involving Targeted Recruitment And Subsequent Spreading Of Histone Acetyltransferase Activity To Encompass And Activate A Remote Target Gene.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	p300/CBP-associated factor histone acetyltransferase processing of a peptide substrate. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic mechanism. P300/Cbp-Associated Factor (Pcaf) Is A Histone Acetyltransferase That Plays An Important Role In The Remodeling Of Chromatin And The Regulation Of Gene Expression. It Has Been Shown To Catalyze Preferentially Acetylation Of The Epsilon-Amino Group Of Lysine 14 In Histone H3. In This Study, The Kinetic Mechanism Of Pcaf Was Evaluated With A 20-Amino Acid Peptide Substrate Derived From The Amino Terminus Of Histone H3 (H3-20) And Recombinant Bacterially Expressed Pcaf Catalytic Domain (Pcaf(Cat)). The Enzymologic Behavior Of Full-Length Pcaf And Pcaf(Cat) Were Shown To Be Similar. Pcaf-Catalyzed Acetylation Of The Substrate H3-20 Was Shown To Be Specific For Lys-14, Analogous To Its Behavior With The Full-Length Histone H3 Protein. Two-Substrate Kinetic Analysis Displayed An Intersecting Line Pattern, Consistent With A Ternary Complex Mechanism For Pcaf. The Dead-End Inhibitor Analog Desulfo-Coa Was Competitive Versus Acetyl-Coa And Noncompetitive Versus H3-20. The Dead-End Analog Inhibitor H3-20 K14A Was Competitive Versus H3-20 And Uncompetitive Versus Acetyl-Coa. The Potent Bisubstrate Analog Inhibitor H3-Coa-20 Was Competitive Versus Acetyl-Coa And Noncompetitive Versus H3-20. Taken Together, These Inhibition Patterns Support An Ordered Bibi Kinetic Mechanism For Pcaf In Which Acetyl-Coa Binding Precedes H3-20 Binding. Viscosity Experiments Suggest That Diffusional Release Of Product Is Not Rate-Determining For Pcaf Catalysis. These Results Provide A Mechanistic Framework For Understanding The Detailed Catalytic Behavior Of An Important Subset Of The Histone Acetyltransferases And Have Significant Implications For Molecular Regulation Of And Inhibitor Design For These Enzymes.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Effects of core histone tail domains on the equilibrium constants for dynamic DNA site accessibility in nucleosomes. The N And C-Terminal Tail Domains Of The Core Histones Play Important Roles In Gene Regulation, But The Mechanisms Through Which They Act Are Not Known. These Tail Domains Are Highly Positively Charged And Are The Sites Of Numerous Post-Translational Modifications, Including Many Sites For Lysine Acetylation. Nucleosomes In Which These Tail Domains Have Been Removed By Trypsin Remain Otherwise Intact, And Are Used By Many Laboratories As A Model System For Highly Acetylated Nucleosomes. Here, We Test The Hypothesis That One Role Of The Tail Domains Is To Directly Regulate The Accessibility Of Nucleosomal Dna To Other Dna-Binding Proteins. Three Assays Are Used: Equilibrium Binding By A Site-Specific, Dna-Binding Protein, And Dynamic Accessibility To Restriction Enzymes Or To A Non-Specific Exonuclease. The Effects Of Removal Of The Tail Domains As Monitored By Each Of These Assays Can Be Understood Within The Framework Of The Site Exposure Model For The Dynamic Equilibrium Accessibility Of Target Sites Located Within The Nucleosomal Dna. Removal Of The Tail Domains Leads To A 1.5 To 14-Fold Increase In Position-Dependent Equilibrium Constants For Site Exposure. The Smallness Of The Effect Weighs Against Models For Gene Activation In Which Histone Acetylation Is A Mandatory Initial Event, Required To Facilitate Subsequent Access Of Regulatory Proteins To Nucleosomal Dna Target Sites. Alternative Roles For Histone Acetylation In Gene Regulation Are Discussed.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation and the control of the cell cycle. The Critical Steps Of The Cell Cycle Are Generally Controlled Through The Transcriptional Regulation Of Specific Subsets Of Genes. Transcriptional Regulation Has Been Recently Linked To Acetylation Or Deacetylation Of Core Histone Tails: Acetylated Histone Tails Are Generally Associated With Active Chromatin, Whereas Deacetylated Histone Tails Are Associated With Silent Parts Of The Genome. A Number Of Transcriptional Co-Regulators Are Histone Acetyl-Transferases Or Histone Deacetylases. Here, We Discuss Some Of The Critical Cell Cycle Steps In Which These Enzymes Are Involved.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Transcriptional repression by blimp-1 (PRDI-BF1) involves recruitment of histone deacetylase. B-Lymphocyte-Induced Maturation Protein (Blimp-1) Is A Transcriptional Repressor That Is Considered To Be A Master Regulator Of Terminal B-Cell Development Because It Is Sufficient To Trigger Differentiation In The Bcl(1)-Cell Model. Transcription Of The C-Myc Gene Is Repressed By Blimp-1 During B-Cell Differentiation. In This Study, We Have Explored The Mechanism By Which Blimp-1 Represses Transcription By Using Gal4-Fusion Protein Assays And Assays In Which Blimp-1 Represses The Natural C-Myc Promoter. The Results Show That Blimp-1 Represses The C-Myc Promoter By An Active Mechanism That Is Independent Of The Adjacently Bound Activator Yy1. Blimp-1 Contains Two Regions That Independently Associate With Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) And Endogenous Blimp-1 In Nuclear Extracts Binds In Vitro To The C-Myc Blimp-1 Site In A Complex Containing Hdac. The Functional Importance Of Recruiting Hdac For Blimp-1-Dependent Repression Of C-Myc Transcription Is Supported By Two Experiments. First, The Hdac Inhibitor Tricostatin A Inhibits Blimp-1-Dependent Repression In Cotransfection Assays. Second, A Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Shows That Expression Of Blimp-1 Causes Deacetylation Of Histone H3 Associated With The C-Myc Promoter, And This Deacetylation Depends On The Blimp-1 Binding Site In The C-Myc Promoter.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Architectural transcription factors and the SAGA complex function in parallel pathways to activate transcription. Recent Work Has Shown That Transcription Of The Yeast Ho Gene Involves The Sequential Recruitment Of A Series Of Transcription Factors. We Have Performed A Functional Analysis Of Ho Regulation By Determining The Ability Of Mutations In Sin1, Sin3, Rpd3, And Sin4 Negative Regulators To Permit Ho Expression In The Absence Of Certain Activators. Mutations In The Sin1 (=Spt2) Gene Do Not Affect Ho Regulation, In Contrast To Results Of Other Studies Using An Ho:Lacz Reporter, And Our Data Show That The Regulatory Properties Of An Ho:Lacz Reporter Differ From That Of The Native Ho Gene. Mutations In Sin3 And Rpd3, Which Encode Components Of A Histone Deacetylase Complex, Show The Same Pattern Of Genetic Suppression, And This Suppression Pattern Differs From That Seen In A Sin4 Mutant. The Sin4 Protein Is Present In Two Transcriptional Regulatory Complexes, The Rna Polymerase Ii Holoenzyme/Mediator And The Saga Histone Acetylase Complex. Our Genetic Analysis Allows Us To Conclude That Swi/Snf Chromatin Remodeling Complex Has Multiple Roles In Ho Activation, And The Data Suggest That The Ability Of The Sbf Transcription Factor To Bind To The Ho Promoter May Be Affected By The Acetylation State Of The Ho Promoter. We Also Demonstrate That The Nhp6 Architectural Transcription Factor, Encoded By The Redundant Nhp6A And Nhp6B Genes, Is Required For Ho Expression. Suppression Analysis With Sin3, Rpd3, And Sin4 Mutations Suggests That Nhp6 And Gcn5 Have Similar Functions. A Gcn5 Nhp6A Nhp6B Triple Mutant Is Extremely Sick, Suggesting That The Saga Complex And The Nhp6 Architectural Transcription Factors Function In Parallel Pathways To Activate Transcription. We Find That Disruption Of Sin4 Allows This Strain To Grow At A Reasonable Rate, Indicating A Critical Role For Sin4 In Detecting Structural Changes In Chromatin Mediated By Gcn5 And Nhp6. These Studies Underscore The Critical Role Of Chromatin Structure In Regulating Ho Gene Expression.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Interplay between chromatin modifying and remodeling complexes in transcriptional regulation. The Question Of A Possible Functional Relationship Between Different Chromatin-Altering Enzymatic Activities Is Of Great Interest. Several Remarkable Parallels Have Been Revealed Regarding The Action Of The Remodeling Complex Swi/Snf And The Histone Acetylation Complex Saga During Transcriptional Activation In S. Cerevisiae. Many Promoters, But Not All, That Require One Complex Require The Other As Well. Mutations That Disrupt Both Complexes Cause Much More Severe Phenotypes Than Single Mutations. Both Types Of Complexes Are Recruited To Specific Promoters By Interaction With Dna-Bound Acidic Activators, Resulting In Targeted Acetylation And Transcriptional Activation. Taken Together The Data Argue For Independent Mechanisms, But Similar Recruitment And Functional Interplay Between These Two Types Of Chromatin-Altering Activities.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Control of histone modifications. A Role For Histone Modifications In Transcription Processes And The Remodeling Of Chromatin Structure Has Been Established. This Review Highlights The Recent Advances Made In Studies On Histone Acetyltransferases, Histone Deacetylases, Histone Kinases, And Protein Phosphatases, As Well As Their Roles In Transcriptional Activation And Repression. Coactivators With Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Stimulate Transcription, Whereas Corepressors With Histone Deacetylase Activity Repress Transcription. Families Of Histone Acetyltransferases And Deacetylases Have Been Identified. We Have Learned That Their Substrates Are Not Limited To Histones But Also Include Transcription Factors And Architectural Proteins. Studies On The Composition Of Multiprotein Complexes With Histone Acetyltransferase Or Histone Deacetylase Have Revealed Mechanisms By Which These Complexes Are Recruited To Specific Genomic Sites That Are Transcriptionally Active, Silenced, Or Being Repaired. A New And Exciting Development, Presented In This Review, Is The Role Of Signal Transduction Pathways In The Phosphorylation Of Histone H3 And The Expression Of Immediate-Early Genes. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppls. 32/33:141-148, 1999.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Epigenetic inheritance of active chromatin after removal of the main transactivator. The Drosophila Polycomb And Trithorax Group Proteins Act Through Chromosomal Elements Such As Fab-7 To Maintain Repressed Or Active Gene Expression, Respectively. A Fab-7 Element Is Switched From A Silenced To A Mitotically Heritable Active State By An Embryonic Pulse Of Transcription. Here, Histone H4 Hyperacetylation Was Found To Be Associated With Fab-7 After Activation, Suggesting That H4 Hyperacetylation May Be A Heritable Epigenetic Tag Of The Activated Element. Activated Fab-7 Enables Transcription Of A Gene Even After Withdrawal Of The Primary Transcription Factor. This Feature May Allow Epigenetic Maintenance Of Active States Of Developmental Genes After Decay Of Their Early Embryonic Regulators.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cloning and analysis of a Toxoplasma gondii histone acetyltransferase: a novel chromatin remodelling factor in Apicomplexan parasites. The Yeast Transcriptional Adaptor Gcn5 Functions As A Histone Acetyltransferase, Directly Linking Chromatin Modification To Transcriptional Regulation. Homologues Of Yeast Gcn5 Have Been Found In Tetrahymena, Drosophila, Arabidopsis And Human, Suggesting That This Pathway Of Chromatin Remodelling Is Evolutionarily Conserved. Consistent With This View, We Have Identified The Toxoplasma Gondii Homologue, Referred To Here As Tggcn5. The Gene Codes For A Protein Of 474 Amino Acids With An Estimated Molecular Mass Of 53 Kda. The Protein Reveals Two Regions Of Close Similarity With The Gcn5 Family Members, The Hat Domain And The Bromodomain. Tg Gcn5 Occurs In A Single Copy In The T.Gondii Genome. The Introduction Of A Second Copy Of Tggcn5 In T.Gondii Tachyzoites Is Toxic Unless The Hat Activity Is Disrupted By A Single Point Mutation. Full Tggcn5 Does Not Complement The Growth Defect In A Yeast Gcn5 (-)Mutant Strain, But A Chimera Comprising The T.Gondii Hat Domain Fused To The Remainder Of Ygcn5 Does. These Data Show That T.Gondii Gnc5 Is A Histone Acetyltransferase Attesting To The Significance Of Chromatin Remodelling In Gene Regulation Of Apicomplexa.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Functional interaction between GCN5 and polyamines: a new role for core histone acetylation. Polyamines Are Organic Polycations Essential For A Wide Variety Of Cellular Functions, Including Nuclear Integrity And Chromosome Condensation. Here We Present Genetic Evidence That Depletion Of Cellular Polyamines Partially Alleviates The Defects In Ho And Suc2 Expression Caused By Inactivation Of The Gcn5 Histone Acetyltransferase. In Addition, The Combination Of Polyamine Depletion And A Sin(-) Allele Of The Histone H4 Gene Leads To Almost Complete Bypass Of The Transcriptional Requirement For Gcn5. In Contrast, Polyamine Depletion Does Not Alter The Transcriptional Requirements For The Swi/Snf Chromatin Remodeling Complex Nor Does Depletion Lead To Global Defects In Transcriptional Regulation. In Addition To These Genetic Studies, We Show That Polyamines Facilitate Oligomerization Of Nucleosomal Arrays In Vitro, And That Polyamine-Mediated Condensation Requires Intact Core Histone N-Terminal Domains And Is Inhibited By Histone Hyperacetylation. Our Studies Suggest That Polyamines Are Repressors Of Transcription In Vivo, And That One Role Of Histone Hyperacetylation Is To Antagonize The Ability Of Polyamines To Stabilize Highly Condensed States Of Chromosomal Fibers.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The yeast HML I silencer defines a heterochromatin domain boundary by directional establishment of silencing. The Eukaryotic Genome Is Divided Into Functional Domains Defined In Part By Local Differences In Chromatin Structure And Delimited In Many Cases By Boundary Elements. The Hml And Hmr Loci In The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Are Transcriptionally Silent Chromosome Domains. Each Locus Is Bracketed By Two Cis-Acting Sequences, Designated E And I, That Serve To Establish And Maintain Repression Of Genes Within Each Locus. We Show That Repression At Hml Is Uniformly High Between E And I But Decreases Sharply Beyond I. The Region Of Repression At Hml Generally Correlates With The Domain Of Histone Hypoacetylation. Despite The Sharp Definition Of The Boundaries Of Hml, No Sequence Capable Of Blocking The Spread Of Heterochromatin Resides In The Sequences Flanking Hml. We Find, Though, That Inverting The Orientation Of I Increases Silencing Outside Of Hml While Weakening Silencing Within Hml. These Results Indicate That The Hml I Silencer Establishes A Boundary Between Active And Inactive Chromatin At Hml, But Does So By Organizing Inactive Chromatin In Only One Direction. This Represents A Different Mechanism For Delimiting The Boundaries Of A Eukaryotic Chromosome Domain.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	NuA4, an essential transcription adaptor/histone H4 acetyltransferase complex containing Esa1p and the ATM-related cofactor Tra1p. Post-Translational Acetylation Of Histone H4 N-Terminal Tail In Chromatin Has Been Associated With Several Nuclear Processes Including Transcription. We Report The Purification And Characterization Of A Native Multisubunit Complex (Nua4) From Yeast That Acetylates Nucleosomal Histone H4. Nua4 Has An Apparent Molecular Mass Of 1.3 Mda. All Four Conserved Lysines Of Histone H4 Can Be Acetylated By Nua4. We Have Identified The Catalytic Subunit Of The Complex As The Product Of Esa1, An Essential Gene Required For Cell Cycle Progression In Yeast. Antibodies Against Esa1P Specifically Immunoprecipitate Nua4 Activity Whereas The Complex Purified From A Temperature-Sensitive Esa1 Mutant Loses Its Acetyltransferase Activity At The Restrictive Temperature. Additionally, We Have Identified Another Subunit Of The Complex As The Product Of Tra1, An Atm-Related Essential Gene Homologous To Human Trrap, An Essential Cofactor For C-Myc- And E2F-Mediated Oncogenic Transformation. Finally, The Ability Of Nua4 To Stimulate Gal4-Vp16-Driven Transcription From Chromatin Templates In Vitro Is Also Lost In The Temperature-Sensitive Esa1 Mutant. The Function Of The Essential Esa1 Protein As The Hat Subunit Of Nua4 And The Presence Of Tra1P, A Putative Transcription Activator-Interacting Subunit, Supports An Essential Link Between Nuclear H4 Acetylation, Transcriptional Regulation And Cell Cycle Control.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Nuclear receptors, their coactivators and modulation of transcription. Nuclear Receptors Are Ligand-Dependent Transcription Factors Which Can Also Be Activated In The Absence Of Their Lipophilic Ligands By Signaling Substances Acting On Cell Membrane Receptors. This Ligand-Independent Activation Indicates The Importance Of Nuclear Receptor Phosphorylation For Their Function. Nuclear Receptor-Mediated Transcription Of Target Genes Is Further Increased By Interactions With Recruited Coactivators Forming A Novel Family Of Nuclear Proteins. Cbp/P300, A Coactivator Of Different Classes Of Transcription Factors, Including The Tumor Suppressor Protein P53, Plays A Special Role Acting As A Bridging Protein Between Inducible Transcription Factors And The Basal Transcription Apparatus, And As An Integrator Of Diverse Signaling Pathways. Coactivators Of Nuclear Receptors And Associated Proteins Forming A Multicomponent Complex Have An Intrinsic Histone Acetylase Activity In Contrast To Nuclear Receptor And Heterodimer Mad-Max Corepressors, Which Recruit Histone Deacetylase. Similarly The Rb Protein Interacts With Histone Deacetylase To Repress Transcription Of Cell Cycle Regulatory Genes. Targeted Histone Acetylation/Deacetylation Results In Remodeling Of Chromatin Structure And Correlates With Activation/Repression Of Transcription. Recent Data Point To The Important Role Of Coactivator Proteins Associated With Inducible Transcription Factors In Transcription Regulation, And In The Integration Of Multiple Signal Transduction Pathways Within The Nucleus.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Retinoid receptors in health and disease: co-regulators and the chromatin connection. Retinoid Receptors Behave As Ligand-Dependent Transcriptional Regulators, Repressing Transcription In The Absence Of Ligand And Activating Transcription In Its Presence. The Different Effects On Transcription Are Carried Out Through Recruitment Of Co-Regulators: Unliganded Receptors Bind Corepressors (Ncor And Smrt) That Are Found Within A Complex Containing Histone Deacetylase (Hdac) Activity, Whereas Liganded Receptors Recruit Coactivators With Histone Acetylase Activity (Hats). Chromatin Remodeling Activities Have Also Shown To Be Required, Suggesting A Hierarchy Of Promoter Structure Modifications In Ra Target Genes Carried Out By Multiple Coregulatory Complexes. In This Review, We Examine The Experimental Evidence For The Model Just Sketched. We Focus On Recent Findings Highlighting New Molecular Details In Receptor-Coregulator Interactions, Including The Discovery And Initial Characterisation Of Novel Complexes With Multiple Chromatin Modifying Activities. Finally, We Look At The Role Of Aberrant Recruitment Of The Ncorhdac Complex By Altered Retinoid Receptors In The Pathogenesis Of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia. These Results Point To A Crucial Role For Control Of Transcription Factor Coregulator Interactions In The Regulation Of Cellular Processes, And Suggest New Molecular Targets For Cancer Therapy.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	MAP kinase-mediated signalling to nucleosomes and immediate-early gene induction. Extracellular Signals Are Transduced Into The Nucleus Through A Variety Of Signalling Mechanisms To Elicit Changes In Patterns Of Gene Expression. This Review Is Focused In The Map Kinase Cascades And The Part They Play In The Induction Of The Immediate-Early (Ie) Genes. We Discuss The Map Kinases And Their Downstream Effectors That Are Known To Phosphorylate Substrates In The Nucleus. In Addition To Phosphorylating Specific Transcription Factors, Map Kinases And Their Downstream Kinases Are Implicated In Eliciting Rapidly Targeted Alterations In The Chromatin Environment Of Specific Genes By Modulating The Phosphorylation And/Or Acetylation Of Nucleosomal And Chromatin Proteins.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation in signal transduction by growth regulatory signals. Cell Fate Is Determined By Extracellular Signals Which Are Transmitted To The Nucleus And Result In The Transcriptional Regulation Of Specific Subsets Of Genes. Transcriptional Regulation Has Been Recently Linked To Enzymatic Activities Which Are Able To Acetylate Or Deacetylate Core Histone Tails. A Number Of Transcriptional Co-Regulators Are Histone Acetyl-Transferases Or Histone Deacetylases. Here, We Discuss The Involvement Of These Enzymes In Critical Steps Of Cell Proliferation Or Cell Differentiation Control
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetyltransferase complexes. Modification Of Histone Amino Terminal Tails By Acetylation Has Long Been Linked To The Transcriptional Capacity Of Genes In Chromatin And To Various Aspects Of Chromatin Dynamics. Over The Last Few Years A Flurry Of Reports Have Described The Purification And Identification Of A Large Number Of Histone Acetyltransferases. Many Of These Enzymes Had Previously Been Described As Transcriptional Regulators And Have Frequently Been Isolated As Part Of Larger Multisubunit Protein Complexes. This Review Describes The Association Of Acetyltransferases With Partner Proteins And The Additional Functional Attributes Of Such Complexes Beyond Catalytic Function.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Extensive Studies In The Past Few Years Have Begun To Demonstrate That Chromosome Structure Plays A Critical Role In Transcriptional Regulation. Two Highly Conserved Mechanisms For Altering Chromosome Structure Have Been Identified: 1) Post-Translational Modification Of Histones And 2) Adenosine Triphosphate (Atp)-Dependent Chromosome Remodeling. Acetylation Of Histone Lysine Residues Has Been Known For Three Decades To Be Associated With Transcriptional Activation. Recent Discoveries, However, Show That A Number Of Transcriptional Regulators Are Histone Acetylases Or Histone Deacetylases. Specific Dna-Binding Transcription Factors Recruit Histone Acetylases And Deacetylases To Promoters To Activate Or Repress Transcription. These Results Strongly Support The Notion That Histone Acetylation And Deacetylation Play An Important Role In Transcriptional Regulation. Recent Findings Have Also Provided Insight Into The Molecular Mechanisms By Which Atp-Dependent Chromosome-Remodeling Activities Participate In Transcriptional Regulation. Furthermore, Some Atp-Dependent Chromosome-Remodeling Activities Have Been Shown To Complex With Histone Deacetylases. In The Complexes Studied To Date, The Atp-Dependent Chromosome-Remodeling Activity Enhances The Histone Deacetylase Activity. Therefore, The Two Mechanisms Appear To Work In Concert To Achieve Precise Control Of Transcription. Disruption Of Chromosome Remodeling Has Been Linked To A Number Of Diseases, And A Complete Understanding Of The Complex Chromosome-Remodeling Machinery May Lead To The Development Of New Therapies.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cell cycle-regulated histone acetylation required for expression of the yeast HO gene. Expression Of The Yeast Ho Gene In Late G1 Of The Cell Cycle Requires The Swi/Snf Chromatin Remodeling Complex, The Gcn5P Histone Acetyltransferase, And Two Different Sequence-Specific Transcriptional Activators, Swi5P And Swi4P/Swi6P. We Have Used Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays To Investigate The Role Of Each Of These Trans-Acting Factors In Establishing A Cell Cycle-Regulated Domain Of Histone Acetylation Surrounding The Ho Upstream Regulatory Region. We Detect A Approximately 1-Kb Domain Of H3 And H4 Acetylation That Is Established In Mid-G1, Prior To And Independent Of Ho Transcription, Which Then Declines With Kinetics Similar To Inactivation Of Ho. This Cell Cycle Burst Of Histone Acetylation Requires Gcn5P, Swi/Snf, And The Swi5P Activator, But Occurs In The Absence Of The Swi4P Activator. We Also Find That Inactivation Of The Sin3P/Rpd3P Deacetylase Complex Leads To A High Level Of Acetylation At The Ho Locus Throughout The Cell Cycle. We Propose A Sequential Model For Activation Of Ho In Which The Swi5P-Dependent Recruitment Of The Gcn5P Acetyltransferase Requires Chromatin Remodeling Events By The Swi/Snf Complex.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The nucleosome remodeling complex, Snf/Swi, is required for the maintenance of transcription in vivo and is partially redundant with the histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5. Snf/Swi, A Nucleosome Remodeling Complex, Is Important For Overcoming Nucleosome-Mediated Repression Of Transcription In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We Have Addressed The Mechanism By Which Snf/Swi Controls Transcription In Vivo Of An Snf/Swi-Dependent Promoter, That Of The Suc2 Gene. By Single-Cell Analysis, Our Results Show That Snf/Swi Is Required For Activated Levels Of Suc2 Expression In Every Cell Of A Population. In Addition, Snf/Swi Is Required For Maintenance Of Suc2 Transcription, Suggesting That Continuous Chromatin Remodeling Is Necessary To Maintain An Active Transcriptional State. Finally, Snf/Swi And Gcn5, A Histone Acetyltransferase, Have Partially Redundant Roles In The Control Of Suc2 Transcription, Suggesting A Functional Overlap Between Two Different Mechanisms Believed To Overcome Repression By Nucleosomes, Nucleosome Remodeling And Histone Acetylation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A novel H2A/H4 nucleosomal histone acetyltransferase in Tetrahymena thermophila. Recently, We Reported The Identification Of A 55-Kda Polypeptide (P55) From Tetrahymena Macronuclei As A Catalytic Subunit Of A Transcription-Associated Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat A). Extensive Homology Between P55 And Gcn5P, A Component Of The Saga And Ada Transcriptional Coactivator Complexes In Budding Yeast, Suggests An Immediate Link Between The Regulation Of Chromatin Structure And Transcriptional Output. Here We Report The Characterization Of A Second Transcription-Associated Hat Activity From Tetrahymena Macronuclei. This Novel Activity Is Distinct From Complexes Containing P55 And Putative Ciliate Saga And Ada Components And Shares Several Characteristics With Nua4 (For Nucleosomal H2A/H4), A 1.8-Mda, Gcn5P-Independent Hat Complex Recently Described In Yeast. A Key Feature Of Both The Nua4 And Tetrahymena Activities Is Their Acetylation Site Specificity For Lysines 5, 8, 12, And 16 Of H4 And Lysines 5 And 9 Of H2A In Nucleosomal Substrates, Patterns That Are Distinct From Those Of Known Gcn5P Family Members. Moreover, Like Nua4, The Tetrahymena Activity Is Capable Of Activating Transcription From Nucleosomal Templates In Vitro In An Acetyl Coenzyme A-Dependent Fashion. Unlike Nua4, However, Sucrose Gradient Analyses Of The Ciliate Enzyme, Following Sequential Denaturation And Renaturation, Estimate The Molecular Size Of The Catalytically Active Subunit To Be Approximately 80 Kda, Consistent With The Notion That A Single Polypeptide Or A Stable Subcomplex Is Sufficient For This H2A/H4 Nucleosomal Hat Activity. Together, These Data Document The Importance Of This Novel Hat Activity For Transcriptional Activation From Chromatin Templates And Suggest That A Second Catalytic Hat Subunit, In Addition To P55/Gcn5P, Is Conserved Between Yeast And Tetrahymena.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Activation domain-specific and general transcription stimulation by native histone acetyltransferase complexes. Recent Progress In Identifying The Catalytic Subunits Of Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Complexes Has Implicated Histone Acetylation In The Regulation Of Transcription. Here, We Have Analyzed The Function Of Two Native Yeast Hat Complexes, Saga (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase) And Nua4 (Nucleosome Acetyltransferase Of H4), In Activating Transcription From Preassembled Nucleosomal Array Templates In Vitro. Each Complex Was Tested For The Ability To Enhance Transcription Driven By Gal4 Derivatives Containing Either Acidic, Glutamine-Rich, Or Proline-Rich Activation Domains. On Nucleosomal Array Templates, The Saga Complex Selectively Stimulates Transcription Driven By The Vp16 Acidic Activation Domain In An Acetyl Coenzyme A-Dependent Manner. In Contrast, The Nua4 Complex Facilitates Transcription Mediated By Any Of The Activation Domains Tested If Allowed To Preacetylate The Nucleosomal Template, Indicating A General Stimulatory Effect Of Histone H4 Acetylation. However, When The Extent Of Acetylation By Nua4 Is Limited, The Complex Also Preferentially Stimulates Vp16-Driven Transcription. Saga And Nua4 Interact Directly With The Vp16 Activation Domain But Not With A Glutamine-Rich Or Proline-Rich Activation Domain. These Data Suggest That Recruitment Of The Saga And Nua4 Hat Complexes By The Vp16 Activation Domain Contributes To Hat-Dependent Activation. In Addition, Extensive H4/H2B Acetylation By Nua4 Leads To A General Activation Of Transcription, Which Is Independent Of Activator-Nua4 Interactions.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Chromatin remodeling: a marriage between two families?. The Compaction Of The Eukaryotic Genome Into A Highly Folded Chromatin Structure Necessitates Cellular Mechanisms For Allowing Access Of Regulatory Proteins To The Dna Template. Recent Advances In The Fields Of Gene Silencing, Transcription, Recombination, And Dna Repair Have Led To The Identification Of Two Distinct Families Of Chromatin Remodeling Enzymes--Nuclear Histone Acetyltransferases And Multisubunit Complexes That Harbor A Swi2/Snf2 Atpase Family Member. This Paper Reviews The Current Notion Of How These Enzymes Function In Remodeling Chromatin; We Then Discuss Some Tantalizing Lines Of Evidence That Lead To The Hypothesis That Members Of Both Families May Actually Function In Concert To Facilitate Cellular Processes In The Context Of Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Purified histone acetyltransferase complexes stimulate HIV-1 transcription from preassembled nucleosomal arrays. Protein Acetylation Has Been Implicated In The Regulation Of Hiv-1 Gene Transcription. Here, We Have Exploited The Activities Of Four Native Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Complexes From Yeast To Directly Test Whether Acetylation Regulates Hiv-1 Transcription In Vitro. Hat Activities Acetylating Either Histone H3 (Saga, Ada, And Nua3) Or H4 (Nua4) Stimulate Hiv-1 Transcription From Preassembled Nucleosomal Templates In An Acetyl Coa-Dependent Manner. Hiv-1 Transcription From Histone-Free Dna Is Not Affected By The Hats, Indicating That These Activities Function In A Chromatin-Specific Fashion. For Ada And Nua4, We Demonstrate That Acetylation Of Only Histone Proteins Mediates Enhanced Transcription, Suggesting That These Complexes Facilitate Transcription At Least In Part By Modifying Histones. To Address A Potential Mechanism By Which Hat Complexes Stimulate Transcription, We Performed A Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Analysis. Each Of The Hats Increases The Cutting Efficiencies Of Restriction Endonucleases Targeting The Hiv-1 Chromatin Templates In A Manner Not Requiring Transcription, Suggesting That Histone Acetylation Leads To Nucleosome Remodeling.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The LAZ3(BCL-6) oncoprotein recruits a SMRT/mSIN3A/histone deacetylase containing complex to mediate transcriptional repression. Recent Works Demonstrated That Some Transcriptional Repressors Recruit Histone Deacetylases (Hdacs) Either Through Direct Interaction, Or As A Member Of A Multisubunit Repressing Complex Containing Other Components Referred To As Corepressors. For Instance, The Bhlh-Zip Transcriptional Repressors Mad/Mxi Recruit Hdacs Together With The Msin3 Corepressors, Whereas Unliganded Nuclear Receptors Contact Another Corepressor, Smrt (Or Its Relative N-Cor), Which, In Turn, Associates With Both Msin3 And Hdacs To Form The Repressor Complex. Recently, We Reported That Smrt Also Directly Associates With Laz3(Bcl-6), A Poz/Zn Finger Transcriptional Repressor Involvedin The Pathogenesis Of Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. However, Whether Laz3 Recruits The Hdacs-Containing Repression Complex Is Currently Unknown. We Report Here That Laz3 Associates With Corepressor Msin3A Both In Vivo And In Vitro , And Found That A Central Region, Which Harbours Autonomous Repression Activity, Is Mainly Responsible For This Interaction. Conversely, The N-Terminal Half Of Msin3A Is Both Necessary And Sufficient To Bind Laz3. Moreover, We Show That Laz3 Also Interacts With An Hdac (Hdac-1) Through Its Poz Domain In Vitro While The Immunoprecipitation Of Laz3 Results In The Coretention Of An Endogenous Hdac Activity In Vivo . Finally, Inhibitors Of Hdacs Significantly Reduce The Laz3-Mediated Repression. Taken Together, We Conclude That Laz3 Recruits A Repressing Complex Containing Smrt, Msin3A And A Hdac, And That Its Full Repressing Potential On Transcription Requires Hdacs Activity. Our Results Identify Hdacs As Molecular Targets Of Laz3 Oncogene And Further Strengthen The Connection Between Aberrant Chromatin Acetylation And Human Cancers.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Identification and mapping of human histone acetylation modifier gene homologues. The Products Of Histone Acetyltransferase And Deacetyltransferase Genes Regulate Histone Acetylation In Eukaryotes, Thereby Regulating Access Of Transcription Factors To Chromatin And Modulating Gene Expression. Histone Acetylation Modifiers Have Been Found To Participate As Cofactors In Diverse Mammalian Transcriptional Complexes Involved In Regulation Of Cellular Proliferation And Differentiation. A Role For Histone Acetylase Has Been Implicated In Leukemias And Developmental Disorders. To Gain Insight Into A Role Of Additional Potential Histone Acetylation Modifier Genes In Human Disease, We Identified Six Histone Acetyl-Transferase Or Deacetyltransferase Homologues Using The Dbest Database, And We Mapped, Using High-Resolution Fish, A Total Of Five Family Members To 1P34.3, 6Q21-Q22, 5Q31, 3P24, And 17Q21. We Then Identified Human Genetic Disorders For Which Candidate Genes Are Not Yet Known And That Have Been Mapped To The Same Chromosomal Regions As The Histone Acetylation Modifiers. This Analysis May Help Identify New Candidate Genes For Human Diseases That Involve Disturbances Of Histone Acetylation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	How do histone acetyltransferases select lysine residues in core histones?. Acetylation Of Specific Lysines Of Core Histone N-Terminal Tails Correlates With Chromatin Assembly And Specific Regulation Of Gene Expression. Core Histones Acetylated At Particular Lysines Mediate Effects On Chromatin Function; However, The Manner In Which Different Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) Discriminate Lysines Is Unknown. Here We Propose A Putative Rule For Lysine Selection By Hats Based On The Primary Sequence In The Vicinity Of Lysines In The Core Histone N-Terminal Tails And In Flanking Sequence. This Provides Insight Into The Molecular Basis Of Site Selection Of Core Histones By Hats.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Acetylation and modulation of erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) activity by interaction with histone acetyltransferases. Erythroid Krüppel-Like Factor (Eklf) Is A Red Cell-Specific Transcriptional Activator That Is Crucial For Consolidating The Switch To High Levels Of Adult Beta-Globin Expression During Erythroid Ontogeny. Eklf Is Required For Integrity Of The Chromatin Structure At The Beta-Like Globin Locus, And It Interacts With A Positive-Acting Factor In Vivo. We Find That Eklf Is An Acetylated Transcription Factor, And That It Interacts In Vivo With Cbp, P300, And P/Caf. However, Its Interactions With These Histone Acetyltransferases Are Not Equivalent, As Cbp And P300, But Not P/Caf, Utilize Eklf As A Substrate For In Vitro Acetylation Within Its Trans-Activation Region. The Functional Effects Of These Interactions Are That Cbp And P300, But Not P/Caf, Enhance Eklf'S Transcriptional Activation Of The Beta-Globin Promoter In Erythroid Cells. These Results Establish Eklf As A Tissue-Specific Transcription Factor That Undergoes Post-Translational Acetylation And Suggest A Mechanism By Which Eklf Is Able To Alter Chromatin Structure And Induce Beta-Globin Expression Within The Beta-Like Globin Cluster.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Transcriptional activators direct histone acetyltransferase complexes to nucleosomes. Transcriptional Co-Activators Were Originally Identified As Proteins That Act As Intermediaries Between Upstream Activators And The Basal Transcription Machinery. The Discovery That Co-Activators Such As Tetrahymena And Yeast Gcn5, As Well As Human P300/Cbp, Pcaf, Src-1, Actr And Tafii250, Can Acetylate Histones Suggests That Activators May Be Involved In Targeting Acetylation Activity To Promoters. Several Histone Deacetylases Have Been Linked To Transcriptional Co-Repressor Proteins, Suggesting That The Action Of Both Acetylases And Deacetylases Is Important In The Regulation Of Many Genes. Here We Demonstrate The Binding Of Two Native Yeast Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Complexes To The Herpesvirus Vp16 Activation Domain And The Yeast Transcriptional Activator Gcn4, And Show That It Is Their Interaction With The Vp16 Activation Domain That Targets Gal4-Vp16-Bound Nucleosomes For Acetylation. We Find That Gal4-Vp16-Driven Transcription From Chromatin Templates Is Stimulated By Both Hat Complexes In An Acetyl Coa-Dependent Reaction. Our Results Demonstrate The Targeting Of Native Hat Complexes By A Transcription-Activation Domain To Nucleosomes In Order To Activate Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	A subset of TAF(II)s are integral components of the SAGA complex required for nucleosome acetylation and transcriptional stimulation. A Number Of Transcriptional Coactivator Proteins Have Been Identified As Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Proteins, Providing A Direct Molecular Basis For The Coupling Of Histone Acetylation And Transcriptional Activation. The Yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase (Saga) Complex Requires The Coactivator Protein Gcn5 For Hat Activity. Identification Of Protein Subunits By Mass Spectrometry And Immunoblotting Revealed That The Tata Binding Protein-Associated Factors (Taf(Ii)S) Taf(Ii)90, -68/61, -60, -25/23, And -20/17 Are Integral Components Of This Complex. In Addition, Taf(Ii)68 Was Required For Both Saga-Dependent Nucleosomal Hat Activity And Transcriptional Activation From Chromatin Templates In Vitro. These Results Illustrate A Role For Certain Taf(Ii) Proteins In The Regulation Of Gene Expression At The Level Of Chromatin Modification That Is Distinct From The Tfiid Complex And Taf(Ii)145.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Nuclear histone acetylases and deacetylases and transcriptional regulation: HATs off to HDACs. Reversible Acetylation Of Lysines On The Amino-Terminal Tails Of Nucleosomal Histones Is Correlated With Changes In Chromatin Structure And Transcription. The Recent Characterization Of Enzymes Directly Responsible For Regulating Histone Acetylation And Deacetylation And The Cloning Of Their Encoding Cdnas Have Provided Insights Into The Possible Functional And Regulatory Mechanisms Of These Classes Of Molecules. Nuclear Histone Acetylases Have Been Shown To Be Transcriptional Coactivators And Coactivator-Associated Proteins, While Histone Deacetylases Have Been Identified As Components Of Nuclear Co-Repressor Complexes. These Findings Confirm Previous Studies Linking Histone Acetylation And Transcriptional Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Covalent modifications of histones: expression from chromatin templates. Recent Advances Highlight The Involvement Of Histone Acetyltransferases In Transcriptional Activation And Histone Deacetylases In Transcriptional Repression. Transcription Factors Loaded Onto Regulatory Dna Elements May Recruit Either Coactivators With Histone Acetyltransferase Activity Or Corepressors Associated With Histone Deacetylases. The Recruited Enzymes May Either Acetylate Or Deacetylate Proximal Nucleosomal Histones Or Nonhistone Chromosomal Proteins.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	ESA1 is a histone acetyltransferase that is essential for growth in yeast. Posttranslational Acetylation Of Core Histone Amino Termini Has Long Been Associated With Transcriptionally Active Chromatin. Recent Reports Have Demonstrated Histone Acetyltransferase Activity In A Small Group Of Conserved Transcriptional Regulators Directly Linked To Gene Activation. In Addition, The Presence Of A Putative Acetyltransferase Domain Has Been Discovered In A Group Of Proteins Known As The Myst Family (For Its Founding Members Moz, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, And Tip60). Members Of This Family Are Implicated In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Moz), Transcriptional Silencing In Yeast (Sas2 And Ybf2/Sas3), Hiv Tat Interaction In Humans (Tip60), And Dosage Compensation In Drosophila (Mof). In This Report, We Express A Yeast Orf With Homology To Myst Family Members And Show It Possesses Histone Acetyltransferase Activity. Unlike The Other Myst Family Members In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae This Gene Is Essential For Growth.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Transcriptional repression by UME6 involves deacetylation of lysine 5 of histone H4 by RPD3. The Histone Deacetylase Rpd3 Can Be Targeted To Certain Genes Through Its Interaction With Dna-Binding Regulatory Proteins. Rpd3 Can Then Repress Gene Transcription. In The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Association Of Rpd3 With The Transcriptional Repressors Sin3 And Ume6 Results In Repression Of Reporter Genes Containing The Ume6-Binding Site. Rpd3 Can Deacetylate All Histone H4 Acetylation Sites In Cell Extracts. However, It Is Unknown How H4 Proteins Located At Genes Near Ume6-Binding Sites Are Affected, Nor Whether The Effect Of Rpd3 Is Localized To The Promoter Regions. Here We Study The Mechanism By Which Rpd3 Represses Gene Activity By Examining The Acetylation State Of Histone Proteins At Ume6-Regulated Genes. We Used Antibodies Specific For Individual Acetylation Sites In H4 To Immunoprecipitate Chromatin Fragments. A Deletion Of Rpd3 Or Sin3, But Not Of The Related Histone-Deacetylase Gene Hda1, Results In Increased Acetylation Of The Lysine 5 Residue Of H4 In The Promoters Of The Ume6-Regulated Ino1, Ime2 And Spo13 Genes. As Increased Acetylation Of This Residue Is Not Merely A Consequence Of Gene Transcription, Acetylation Of This Site May Be Essential For Regulating Gene Activity.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Critical residues for histone acetylation by Gcn5, functioning in Ada and SAGA complexes, are also required for transcriptional function in vivo. Several Previously Known Transcription Cofactors Have Been Demonstrated In Vitro Recently To Be Histone Acetyltransferases And Deacetyltransferases, Suggesting That Remodeling Of Chromatin Through Histone Acetylation Plays A Fundamental Role In Gene Regulation. Clear Evidence Has Not Yet Been Obtained, However, To Demonstrate That Histone Acetylation Is Required For Gene Activation In Vivo. In This Study We Performed An Alanine-Scan Mutagenesis Through The Hat (Histone Acetyltransferase) Domain Identified Previously By Deletion Mapping In Recombinant Yeast Gcn5. We Identified Multiple Substitution Mutations That Eliminated Completely Gcn5'S Ability To Potentiate Transcriptional Activation In Vivo. Strikingly, Each Of These Mutations Was Also Critical For Free And Nucleosomal Histone Acetylation By Gcn5 Functioning Within The Native Yeast Hat Complexes, Ada, And Saga. Moreover, The Growth Phenotypes Of These Mutations As Measured By Colony Size And Liquid Growth Assay Closely Tracked Transcription And Hat Activities. In Contrast, Mutations That Did Not Affect In Vivo Function Of Gcn5 Were Able To Acetylate Histones. These Data Argue Strongly That Acetylation Is Required For Gene Regulation By Gcn5 In Vivo, And Support Previous Arguments That Nucleosomal Histones Are Among The Physiological Substrates Of Acetylation By Gcn5.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Activation of SRF-regulated chromosomal templates by Rho-family GTPases requires a signal that also induces H4 hyperacetylation. Constitutively Active Forms Of The Small Gtpases Rhoa (Rhoa.V14) And Cdc42 (Cdc42.V12) Induce Expression Of Extrachromosomal Srf Reporter Genes In Microinjection Experiments, But Only Cdc42.V12 Can Efficiently Activate A Chromosomal Template. Both Sapk/Jnk-Dependent Or -Independent Signals Can Cooperate With Rhoa.V14 To Activate Chromosomal Srf Reporters, And It Is Sapk/Jnk Activation By Cdc42.V12 That Allows It To Activate Chromosomal Templates. Cooperating Signals Can Be Bypassed By Deacetylase Inhibitors. Three Findings Show That Histone H4 Hyperacetylation Is One Target For Cooperating Signals, Although It Alone Is Not Sufficient: (1) Cdc42.V12, But Not Rhoa.V14, Induces H4 Hyperacetylation; (2) Cooperating Signals Use The Same Sapk/Jnk-Dependent Or -Independent Pathways To Induce H4 Hyperacetylation; (3) Growth Factor And Stress Stimuli Induce Substantial H4 Hyperacetylation, Detectable In Reporter Gene Chromatin. These Data Establish A Link Between Signal-Regulated Acetylation Events And Gene Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation as an epigenetic determinant of long-term transcriptional competence. All Four Histones Of The Nucleosome Core Particle Are Subject To Post-Translational Acetylation Of Selected Lysine Residues In Their Amino-Terminal Domains. The Modification Is Ubiquitous And Frequent. Steady-State Levels Of Acetylation Have Been Shown To Vary From One Part Of The Genome To Another And To Be Maintained By A Dynamic Balance Between The Activities Of Two Enzyme Families, The Histone Acetyltransferases (Hats) And Deacetylases (Hdas). The Recent Demonstration That Some At Least Of These Enzymes Are Homologous To, Or Identical With, Known Regulators Of Transcription, Has Renewed Interest In The Involvement Of Histone Acetylation In Transcriptional Control. Acetylation Might Influence The Initiation And/Or Elongation Phases Of Transcription In A Chromatin Context, Possibly By Regulating The Accessibility Of Nucleosomal Dna To Transcription Factors Or The Displacement Of Histones By The Progressing Transcription Complex. But There Is Also Evidence To Suggest That Acetylation Might Be Involved In The Longer-Term Regulation Of Transcription, Acting As A Marker By Which States Of Genetic Activity Or Inactivity Are Maintained From One Cell Generation To The Next. This Review Outlines The Evidence For Such A Role, Using Centric Heterochromatin And The Dosage-Compensated Male X Chromosome In Drosophila As Model Systems, And Suggests Possible Mechanisms By Which It Might Operate.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Linking histone acetylation to transcriptional regulation. In Eukaryotes, Dna Is Assembled With Histones To Form Nucleosomes, The Basic Subunit Of Chromatin Structure. The Wrapping Of Dna Around Histone Octamers To Form Nucleosomal Filaments And Further Folding Of These Filaments Are Necessary To Contain Eukaryotic Genomes Within Nuclei. However, The Dense Packing Of Chromatin In Nuclei And The Association Of Dna With Histones Restrict The Access Of Proteins Involved In Gene Transcription To Dna. Abundant Biochemical Data Supports A Long-Standing Correlation Between Histone Acetylation And Gene Activation, Suggesting That Histone Acetylation Acts To Enhance The Access Of Transcription-Associated Proteins To Dna. However, Despite This Correlation, Nuclear Enzymes Responsible For Transcription-Associated Histone Acetylation Have Been Identified Only Recently. Here We Review Evidence Suggesting That Histone Acetylation Represents A Major Pathway For Transcriptional Regulation, And Discuss Possible Roles For Transcription-Associated Histone Acetyltransferases In This Regulation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Mutations in chromatin components suppress a defect of Gcn5 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Yeast Gcn5 Gene Encodes The Catalytic Subunit Of A Nuclear Histone Acetyltransferase And Is Part Of A High-Molecular-Weight Complex Involved In Transcriptional Regulation. In This Paper We Show That Full Activation Of The Ho Promoter In Vivo Requires The Gcn5 Protein And That Defects In This Protein Can Be Suppressed By Deletion Of The Rpd3 Gene, Which Encodes A Histone Deacetylase. These Results Suggest An Interplay Between Acetylation And Deacetylation Of Histones In The Regulation Of The Ho Gene. We Also Show That Mutations In Either The H4 Or The H3 Histone Gene, As Well As Mutations In The Sin1 Gene, Which Encodes An Hmg1-Like Protein, Strongly Suppress The Defects Produced By The Gcn5 Mutant. These Results Suggest A Hierarchy Of Action In The Process Of Chromatin Remodeling.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Role for ADA/GCN5 products in antagonizing chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression. The Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Swi/Snf Complex Is A 2-Mda Multimeric Assembly That Facilitates Transcriptional Enhancement By Antagonizing Chromatin-Mediated Transcriptional Repression. We Show Here That Mutations In Ada2, Ada3, And Gcn5, Which Are Believed To Encode Subunits Of A Nuclear Histone Acetyltransferase Complex, Cause Phenotypes Strikingly Similar To That Of Swi/Snf Mutants. Ada2, Ada3, And Gcn5 Are Required For Full Expression Of All Swi/Snf-Dependent Genes Tested, Including Ho, Suc2, Ino1, And Ty Elements. Furthermore, Mutations In The Sin1 Gene, Which Encodes A Nonhistone Chromatin Component, Or Mutations In Histone H3 Or H4 Partially Alleviate The Transcriptional Defects Caused By Ada/Gcn5 Or Swi/Snf Mutations. We Also Find That Ada2 Swi1, Ada3 Swi1, And Gcn5 Swi1 Double Mutants Are Inviable And That Mutations In Sin1 Allow Viability Of These Double Mutants. We Have Partially Purified Three Chromatographically Distinct Gcn5-Dependent Acetyltransferase Activities, And We Show That These Enzymes Can Acetylate Both Histones And Sin1P. We Propose A Model In Which The Ada/Gcn5 And Swi/Snf Complexes Facilitate Activator Function By Acting In Concert To Disrupt Or Modify Chromatin Structure.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Cell growth inhibition by the Mad/Max complex through recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. The Organization Of Chromatin Is Crucial For The Regulation Of Gene Expression. In Particular, Both The Positioning And Properties Of Nucleosomes Influence Promoter-Specific Transcription. The Acetylation Of Core Histones Has Been Suggested To Alter The Properties Of Nucleosomes And Affect The Access Of Dna-Binding Transcriptional Regulators To Promoters. A Recently Identified Mammalian Histone Deacetylase (Hd1) Shows Homology To The Yeast Rpd3 Protein, Which Together With Sin3 Affects The Transcription Of Several Genes. Mammalian Sin3 Proteins Interact With The Mad Components Of The Myc/Max/Mad Network Of Cell Growth Regulators. Mad/Max Complexes May Recruit Mammalian Rpd3-Like Enzymes, Therefore, Directing Histone Deacetylase Activity To Promoters And Negatively Regulating Cell Growth.We Report The Identification Of A Tetrameric Complex Composed Of Max, Mad1, Sin3B And Hd1. This Complex Has Histone Deacetylase Activity Which Can Be Blocked By The Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Trichostatin A And Sodium Butyrate. The Inhibition Of Cell Growth By Mad1 Is Enhanced By Sin3B And Hd1, As Measured By Colony Formation Assays. Furthermore, A Mad1-Induced Block Of S-Phase Progression Can Be Overcome By Trichostatin A, As Shown In Microinjection Experiments.The Recruitment Of A Histone Deacetylase By Sequence-Specific Dna-Binding Proteins Provides A Mechanism By Which The State Of Acetylation Of Histones In Nucleosomes And Hence The Activity Of Specific Promoters Can Be Influenced. The Finding That Mad/Max Complexes Interact With Sin3 And Hd1 In Vivo Suggests A Model For The Role Of Mad Proteins In Antagonizing The Function Of Myc Proteins.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation: influence on transcription, nucleosome mobility and positioning, and linker histone-dependent transcriptional repression. We Demonstrate Using A Dinucleosome Template That Acetylation Of The Core Histones Enhances Transcription By Rna Polymerase Iii. This Effect Is Not Dependent On An Increased Mobility Of The Core Histone Octamer With Respect To Dna Sequence. When Linker Histone Is Subsequently Bound, We Find Both A Reduction In Nucleosome Mobility And A Repression Of Transcription. These Effects Of Linker Histone Binding Are Independent Of Core Histone Acetylation, Indicating That Core Histone Acetylation Does Not Prevent Linker Histone Binding And The Concomitant Transcriptional Repression. These Studies Are Complemented By The Use Of A Xenopus Egg Extract Competent Both For Chromatin Assembly On Replicating Dna And For Rna Polymerase Iii Transcription. Incorporation Of Acetylated Histones And Lack Of Linker Histones Together Facilitate Transcription By >10-Fold In This System; However, They Have Little Independent Effect On Transcription. Thus Core Histone Acetylation Significantly Facilitates Transcription, But This Effect Is Inhibited By The Assembly Of Linker Histones Into Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The TAF(II)250 subunit of TFIID has histone acetyltransferase activity. The Transcription Initiation Factor Tfiid Is A Multimeric Protein Complex Composed Of Tata Box-Binding Protein (Tbp) And Many Tbp-Associated Factors (Taf(Ii)S). Taf(Ii)S Are Important Cofactors That Mediate Activated Transcription By Providing Interaction Sites For Distinct Activators. Here, We Present Evidence That Human Taf(Ii)250 And Its Homologs In Drosophila And Yeast Have Histone Acetyltransferase (Hat) Activity In Vitro. Hat Activity Maps To The Central, Most Conserved Portion Of Dtaf(Ii)230 And Ytaf(Ii)130. The Hat Activity Of Dtaf(Ii)230 Resembles That Of Yeast And Human Gcn5 In That It Is Specific For Histones H3 And H4 In Vitro. Our Findings Suggest That Targeted Histone Acetylation At Specific Promoters By Taf(Ii)250 May Be Involved In Mechanisms By Which Tfiid Gains Access To Transcriptionally Repressed Chromatin.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	The histone deacetylase RPD3 counteracts genomic silencing in Drosophila and yeast. Both Position-Effect Variegation (Pev) In Drosophila And Telomeric Position-Effect In Yeast (Tpe) Result From The Mosaic Inactivation Of Genes Relocated Next To A Block Of Centromeric Heterochromatin Or Next To Telomeres. In Many Aspects, These Phenomena Are Analogous To Other Epigenetic Silencing Mechanisms, Such As The Control Of Homeotic Gene Clusters, X-Chromosome Inactivation And Imprinting In Mammals, And Mating-Type Control In Yeast. Dominant Mutations That Suppress Or Enhance Pev Are Thought To Encode Either Chromatin Proteins Or Factors That Directly Affect Chromatin Structure. We Have Identified An Insertional Mutation In Drosophila That Enhances Pev And Reduces Transcription Of The Gene In The Eye-Antenna Imaginal Disc. The Gene Corresponds To That Encoding The Transcriptional Regulator Rpd3 In Yeast, And To A Human Histone Deacetylase. In Yeast, Rrd3-Deletion Strains Show Enhanced Tpe, Suggesting A Conserved Role Of The Histone Deacetylase Rpd3 In Counteracting Genomic Silencing. This Function Of Rpd3, Which Is In Contrast To The General Correlation Between Histone Acetylation And Increased Transcription, Might Be Due To A Specialized Chromatin Structure At Silenced Loci.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	What determines the folding of the chromatin fiber?. In This Review, We Attempt To Summarize, In A Critical Manner, What Is Currently Known About The Processes Of Condensation And Decondensation Of Chromatin Fibers. We Begin With A Critical Analysis Of The Possible Mechanisms For Condensation, Considering Both Old And New Evidence As To Whether The Linker Dna Between Nucleosomes Bends Or Remains Straight In The Condensed Structure. Concluding That The Preponderance Of Evidence Is For Straight Linkers, We Ask What Other Fundamental Process Might Allow Condensation, And Argue That There Is Evidence For Linker Histone-Induced Contraction Of The Internucleosome Angle, As Salt Concentration Is Raised Toward Physiological Levels. We Also Ask How Certain Specific Regions Of Chromatin Can Become Decondensed, Even At Physiological Salt Concentration, To Allow Transcription. We Consider Linker Histone Depletion And Acetylation Of The Core Histone Tails, As Possible Mechanisms. On The Basis Of Recent Evidence, We Suggest A Unified Model Linking Targeted Acetylation Of Specific Genomic Regions To Linker Histone Depletion, With Unfolding Of The Condensed Fiber As A Consequence.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Efficient transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a heterochromatin histone acetylation pattern. Heterochromatin In Metazoans Induces Transcriptional Silencing, As Exemplified By Position Effect Variegation In Drosophila Melanogaster And X-Chromosome Inactivation In Mammals. Heterochromatic Dna Is Packaged In Nucleosomes That Are Distinct In Their Acetylation Pattern From Those Present In Euchromatin, Although The Role These Differences Play In The Structure Of Heterochromatin Or In The Effects Of Heterochromatin On Transcriptional Activity Is Unclear. Here We Report That, As Observed In The Facultative Heterochromatin Of The Inactive X Chromosome In Female Mammalian Cells, Histones H3 And H4 In Chromatin Spanning The Transcriptionally Silenced Mating-Type Cassettes Of The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Are Hypoacetylated Relative To Histones H3 And H4 Of Transcriptionally Active Regions Of The Genome. By Immunoprecipitation Of Chromatin Fragments With Antibodies Specific For H4 Acetylated At Particular Lysine Residues, We Found That Only Three Of The Four Lysine Residues In The Amino-Terminal Domain Of Histone H4 Spanning The Silent Cassettes Are Hypoacetylated. Lysine 12 Shows Significant Acetylation Levels. This Is Identical To The Pattern Of Histone H4 Acetylation Observed In Centric Heterochromatin Of D. Melanogaster. These Two Observations Provide Additional Evidence That The Silent Cassettes Are Encompassed In The Yeast Equivalent Of Metazoan Heterochromatin. Further, Mutational Analysis Of The Amino-Terminal Domain Of Histone H4 In S. Cerevisiae Demonstrated That This Observed Pattern Of Histone H4 Acetylation Is Required For Transcriptional Silencing. This Result, In Conjunction With Prior Mutational Analyses Of Yeast Histones H3 And H4, Indicates That The Particular Pattern Of Nucleosome Acetylation Found In Heterochromatin Is Required For Its Effects On Transcription And Is Not Simply A Side Effect Of Heterochromatin Formation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	All four core histone N-termini contain sequences required for the repression of basal transcription in yeast. Nucleosomes Prevent The Recognition Of Tata Promoter Elements By The Basal Transcriptional Machinery In The Absence Of Induction. However, While Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Histones H3 And H4 Contain N-Terminal Regions Involved In The Activation And Repression Of Gal1 And In The Expression Of Heterochromatin-Like Regions, The Sequences Involved In Repressing Basal Transcription Have Not Yet Been Identified. Here, We Describe The Mapping Of New N-Terminal Domains, In All Four Core Histones (H2A, H2B, H3 And H4), Required For The Repression Of Basal, Uninduced Transcription. Basal Transcription Was Monitored By The Use Of A Gal1 Promoter-Ura3 Reporter Construct Whose Uninduced Activity Can Be Detected Through Cellular Sensitivity To The Drug, 5-Fluoroorotic Acid. We Have Found For Each Histone That The N-Terminal Sequences Repressing Basal Activity Are In A Short Region Adjacent To The Structured Alpha-Helical Core. Analysis Of Minichromosome Dna Topology Demonstrates That The Basal Domains Are Required For The Proper Folding Of Dna Around The Chromosomal Particle. Deletion Of The Basal Domain At Each Histone Significantly Decreases Plasmid Superhelical Density, Which Probably Reflects A Release Of Dna From The Constraints Of The Nucleosome Into The Linker Region. This Provides A Means By Which Basal Factors May Recognize Otherwise Repressed Regulatory Elements.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Special HATs for special occasions: linking histone acetylation to chromatin assembly and gene activation. Post-Translational Acetylation Of The Core Histone Amino-Terminal Tails Has Long Been Associated With Both Chromatin Assembly And The Regulation Of Gene Expression. The Recent Identification And Cloning Of Histone Acetyltransferase Genes Represents A Significant Breakthrough In Our Understanding Of How Specific Acetylation States Are Established. Ongoing Characterization Of These Enzymes And Their Molecular Cohorts Supports A Direct Role For Acetylation In A Signaling Pathway That Modulates Chromatin Structure To Create New Patterns Of Transcription.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Tetrahymena histone acetyltransferase A: a homolog to yeast Gcn5p linking histone acetylation to gene activation. We Report The Cloning Of A Transcription-Associated Histone Acetyltransferase Type A(Hat A). This Tetrahymena Enzyme Is Strikingly Homologous To The Yeast Protein Gcn5, A Putative Transcriptional Adaptor, And We Demonstrate That Recombinant Gcn5P Possesses Hat Activity. Both The Ciliate Enzyme And Gcn5P Contain Potential Active Site Residues Found In Other Acetyltransferases And A Highly Conserved Bromodomain. The Presence Of This Domain In Nuclear A-Type Hats, But Not In Cytoplasmic B-Type Hats, Suggests A Mechanism Whereby Hat A Is Directed To Chromatin To Facilitate Transcriptional Activation. These Findings Shed Light On The Biochemical Function Of The Evolutionarily Conserved Gcn5P-Ada Complex, Directly Linking Histone Acetylation To Gene Activation, And Indicate That Histone Acetylation Is A Targeted Phenomenon.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone acetylation: facts and questions. The Dna Of Eukaryotic Cells Is Organized In A Complex With Proteins, Either As Interphase Chromatin Or Mitotic Chromosomes. Nucleosomes, The Structural Subunits Of Chromatin, Have Long Been Considered As Static Structures, Incompatible With Processes Occurring In Chromatin. During The Past Few Years It Has Become Evident That The Histone Part Of The Nucleosome Has Important Regulatory Functions. Some Of These Functions Are Mediated By The N-Terminal Core Histone Domains Which Contain Sites For Posttranslational Modifications, Among Them Lysine Residues For Reversible Acetylation. Recent Results Indicate That Acetylation And Deacetylation Of N-Terminal Lysines Of Nucleosomal Core Histones Represent A Means Of Molecular Communication Between Chromatin And The Cellular Signal Transduction Network, Resulting In Heritable Epigenetic Information. Data On Enzymes Involved In Acetylation And The Pattern Of Acetylated Lysine Sites On Chromosomes, As Well As Genetic Data On Yeast Transcriptional Repression, Suggest That Acetylation May Lead To Structural Transitions As Well As Specific Signalling Within Distinct Chromatin Domains.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Transcriptional silencing in yeast is associated with reduced nucleosome acetylation. Two Classes Of Sequences In The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Are Subject To Transcriptional Silencing: The Silent Mating-Type Cassettes And Telomeres. In This Report We Demonstrate That The Silencing Of These Regions Is Strictly Associated With Acetylation Of The Epsilon-Amino Groups Of Lysines In The Amino-Terminal Domains Of Three Of The Four Core Histones. Both The Silent Mating-Type Cassettes And The Y Domains Of Telomeres Are Packaged In Nucleosomes In Vivo That Are Hypoacetylated Relative To Those Packaging Active Genes. This Difference In Acetylation Is Eliminated By Genetic Inactivation Of Silencing: The Silent Cassettes From Sir2, Sir3, Or Sir4 Cells Show The Same Level Of Acetylation As Other Active Genes. The Correspondence Of Silencing And Hypoacetylation Of The Mating-Type Cassettes Is Observed Even For An Allele Lacking A Promoter, Indicating That Silencing Per Se, Rather Than The Absence Of Transcription, Is Correlated With Hypoacetylation. Finally, Overexpression Of Sir2P, A Protein Required For Transcriptional Silencing In Yeast, Yields Substantial Histone Deacetylation In Vivo. These Studies Fortify The Hypothesis That Silencing In Yeast Results From Heterochromatin Formation And Argue That The Silencing Proteins Participate In This Formation.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Histone H3 N-terminal mutations allow hyperactivation of the yeast GAL1 gene in vivo. Recent Work Has Shown That The Yeast Histone H4 N-Terminus, While Not Essential For Viability, Is Required For Repression Of The Silent Mating Loci And Activation Of Gal1 And Pho5 Promoters. Because Histone H3 Shares Many Structural Features With Histone H4 And Is Intimately Associated With H4 In The Assembled Nucleosome, We Asked Whether H3 Has Similar Functions. While The Basic N-Terminal Domain Of H3 Is Found To Be Non-Essential (Deletion Of Residues 4-40 Of This 135 Amino Acid Protein Allows Viability), Its Removal Has Only A Minor Effect On Mating. Surprisingly, Both Deletions (Of Residues 4-15) And Acetylation Site Substitutions (At Residues 9, 14 And 18) Within The N-Terminus Of H3 Allow Hyperactivation Of The Gal1 Promoter As Well As A Number Of Other Gal4-Regulated Genes Including Gal2, Gal7 And Gal10. To A Limited Extent Glucose Repression Is Also Alleviated By H3 N-Terminal Deletions. Expression Of Another Inducible Promoter, Pho5, Is Shown To Be Relatively Unaffected. We Conclude That The H3 And H4 N-Termini Have Different Functions In Both The Repression Of The Silent Mating Loci And In The Regulation Of Gal1.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Identification of a non-basic domain in the histone H4 N-terminus required for repression of the yeast silent mating loci. We Have Shown Previously That A Stretch Of Four Charged Residues (16-19) At The Histone H4 N-Terminus Is Involved In Repression Of The Yeast Silent Mating Loci. One Of These Residues, Lys16, Is A Site For Acetylation, Which May Prevent Repression Of The Silent Mating Loci. In This Paper We Ask Whether Other Sequences In Histone H4, Possibly In Conjunction With H3 Residues, Are Required For Repression. We Find That Even In Combination, The Other Seven Acetylatable Lysines In H3 And H4 Do Not Function In Repression. In Contrast, We Have Found That An Adjacent Relatively Uncharged Domain (Residues 21-29) Is Required For Repression And That Single Amino Acid Insertions And Deletions In This Region Are Extremely Detrimental. We Propose That The Basic And Non-Basic Domains Together Form A Dna (Or Protein) Induced Amphipathic Alpha-Helix Required In The Formation Of A Repressive Chromatin Structure.
cerevisiae chromatin histone acetylation regulation expression	Yeast histone H4 N-terminal sequence is required for promoter activation in vivo. To Search For Histone Domains That May Regulate Transcription In Vivo, We Made Deletions And Amino Acid Substitutions In The Histone N-Termini Of S. Cerevisiae. Histone H4 N-Terminal Residues 4-23, Which Include The Extremely Conserved, Reversibly Acetylated Lysines (At Positions 5, 8, 12, And 16), Were Found To Encompass A Region Required For The Activation Of The Gal1 Promoter. Deletions In The H4 N-Terminus Reduce Gal1 Activation 20-Fold. This Effect Is Specific To Histone H4 In That Large Deletions In The N-Termini Of H2A, H2B, And H3 Do Not Similarly Decrease Induction. Activation Of The Pho5 Promoter Is Reduced Approximately 4- To 5-Fold By These H4 Deletions. Mutations In Histone H4 Acetylation Sites And Surrounding Residues Can Cause Comparable And, In Some Cases, Even Greater Effects On Induction Of These Two Promoters. We Postulate That The H4 N-Terminus May Interact With A Component Of The Transcription Initiation Complex, Allowing Nucleosome Unfolding And Subsequent Initiation.

This Paper Opens Up A New Issue Dealing With Luffa Cylindrica (Lc) Lignocellulosic Biomass Recovery In Order To Produce 2G Bioethanol. Lc Fibers Are Composed Of Three Principal Fractions, Namely, Α-Cellulose (45.80%  ± 1.3), Hemicelluloses (20.76%  ± 0.3), And Lignins (13.15%  ± 0.6). The Optimization Of Lc Fibers Hydrothermal And Diluted Acid Pretreatments Duration And Temperature Were Achieved Through The Cubic Central Composite Experimental Design Ccd. The Pretreatments Optimization Was Monitored Via The Determination Of Reducing Sugars. Then, The 2G Bioethanol Process Feasibility Was Tested By Means Of Three Successive Steps, Namely, Lc Fibers Hydrothermal Pretreatment Performed At 96°C During 54 Minutes, Enzymatic Saccharification Carried Out By Means Of A Commercial Enzyme Ap2, And The Alcoholic Fermentation Fulfilled With Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Lc Fibers Hydrothermal Pretreatment Liberated 33.55 G/Kg Of Reducing Sugars. Enzymatic Hydrolysis Allowed Achieving 59.4 G/Kg Of Reducing Sugars. The Conversion Yield Of Reducing Sugar To Ethanol Was 88.66%. After The Distillation Step, Concentration Of Ethanol Was 1.58% With A Volumetric Yield About 70%.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Improvement of ethanol production from crystalline cellulose via optimizing cellulase ratios in cellulolytic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Crystalline Cellulose Is One Of The Major Contributors To The Recalcitrance Of Lignocellulose To Degradation, Necessitating High Dosages Of Cellulase To Digest, Thereby Impeding The Economic Feasibility Of Cellulosic Biofuels. Several Recombinant Cellulolytic Yeast Strains Have Been Developed To Reduce The Cost Of Enzyme Addition, But Few Of These Strains Are Able To Efficiently Degrade Crystalline Cellulose Due To Their Low Cellulolytic Activities. Here, By Combining The Cellulase Ratio Optimization With A Novel Screening Strategy, We Successfully Improved The Cellulolytic Activity Of A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Strain Displaying Four Different Synergistic Cellulases On The Cell Surface. The Optimized Strain Exhibited An Ethanol Yield From Avicel Of 57% Of The Theoretical Maximum, And A 60% Increase Of Ethanol Titer From Rice Straw.

cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Bioethanol production from cellulosic hydrolysates by engineered industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Even Though Industrial Yeast Strains Exhibit Numerous Advantageous Traits For The Production Of Bioethanol, Their Genetic Manipulation Has Been Limited. This Study Demonstrates That An Industrial Polyploidy Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Jhs200 Can Be Engineered Through Cas9 (Crispr Associated Protein 9)-Based Genome Editing. Specifically, We Generated Auxotrophic Mutants And Introduced A Xylose Metabolic Pathway Into The Auxotrophic Mutants. As Expected, The Engineered Strain (Jx123) Enhanced Ethanol Production From Cellulosic Hydrolysates As Compared To Other Engineered Haploid Strains. However, The Jx123 Strain Produced Substantial Amounts Of Xylitol As A By-Product During Xylose Fermentation. Hypothesizing That The Xylitol Accumulation Might Be Caused By Intracellular Redox Imbalance From Cofactor Difference, The Nadh Oxidase From Lactococcus Lactis Was Introduced Into The Jx123 Strain. The Resulting Strain (Jx123_Noxe) Not Only Produced More Ethanol, But Also Produced Xylitol Less Than The Jx123 Strain. These Results Suggest That Industrial Polyploidy Yeast Can Be Modified For Producing Biofuels And Chemicals.

cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Effect of manganese ions on ethanol fermentation by xylose isomerase expressing Saccharomyces cerevisiae under acetic acid stress. The Efficient Fermentation Of Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates In The Presence Of Inhibitors Is Highly Desirable For Bioethanol Production. Among The Inhibitors, Acetic Acid Released During The Pretreatment Of Lignocellulose Negatively Affects The Fermentation Performance Of Biofuel Producing Organisms. In This Study, We Evaluated The Inhibitory Effects Of Acetic Acid On Glucose And Xylose Fermentation By A High Performance Engineered Strain Of Xylose Utilizing Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Sxa-R2P-E, Harboring A Xylose Isomerase Based Pathway. The Presence Of Acetic Acid Severely Decreased The Xylose Fermentation Performance Of This Strain. However, The Acetic Acid Stress Was Alleviated By Metal Ion Supplementation Resulting In A 52% Increased Ethanol Production Rate Under 2G/L Of Acetic Acid Stress. This Study Shows The Inhibitory Effect Of Acetic Acid On An Engineered Isomerase-Based Xylose Utilizing Strain And Suggests A Simple But Effective Method To Improve The Co-Fermentation Performance Under Acetic Acid Stress For Efficient Bioethanol Production.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Engineering of a novel cellulose-adherent cellulolytic Saccharomyces cerevisiae for cellulosic biofuel production. Cellulosic Biofuel Is The Subject Of Increasing Attention. The Main Obstacle Toward Its Economic Feasibility Is The Recalcitrance Of Lignocellulose Requiring Large Amount Of Enzyme To Break. Several Engineered Yeast Strains Have Been Developed With Cellulolytic Activities To Reduce The Need For Enzyme Addition, But Exhibiting Limited Effect. Here, We Report The Successful Engineering Of A Cellulose-Adherent Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Displaying Four Different Synergistic Cellulases On The Cell Surface. The Cellulase-Displaying Yeast Strain Exhibited Clear Cell-To-Cellulose Adhesion And A "Tearing" Cellulose Degradation Pattern; The Adhesion Ability Correlated With Enhanced Surface Area And Roughness Of The Target Cellulose Fibers, Resulting In Higher Hydrolysis Efficiency. The Engineered Yeast Directly Produced Ethanol From Rice Straw Despite A More Than 40% Decrease In The Required Enzyme Dosage For High-Density Fermentation. Thus, Improved Cell-To-Cellulose Interactions Provided A Novel Strategy For Increasing Cellulose Hydrolysis, Suggesting A Mechanism For Promoting The Feasibility Of Cellulosic Biofuel Production.

Efficient Use Of Xylose Along With Glucose Is Necessary For The Economic Production Of Lignocellulosic Based Biofuels. Xylose Transporters Play An Important Role In The Microorganisms For Efficient Utilization Of Xylose. In The Present Study, A Novel Method Has Been Developed For A Rapid Assay Of Xylose Transport Activity In The Xylose-Utilizing Isolates And Other Known Yeasts. An Assay Was Conducted To Compare The Activity Of Β-Xylosidase Using P-Nitrophenyl-Β-D-Xylopyranoside (Pnpx) In The Intact, Intracellular, And Extracellular Yeasts Cells Showing Xylose Transporter. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Mtcc 170) Showed No Xylosidase Activity, While Little Growth Was Observed In The Xylose-Containing Medium. Although Other Yeasts, I.E., Kluyveromyces Marxianus Nire-K1 (Mtcc 5933), K. Marxianus Nire-K3 (Mtcc 5934), And Candida Tropicalis (Mtcc 230), Showed Xylosidase Activity In Intact, Intracellular, And Extracellular Culture. The Xylosidase Activity In Intact Cell Was Higher Than That Of Extracellular And Intracellular Activity In All The Yeast Cells. The Enzyme Activity Was Higher In Case Of K. Marxianus Nire-K1 And K. Marxianus Nire-K3 Rather Than The C. Tropicalis. Further, Better Xylosidase Activity Was Observed In Adapted K. Marxianus Cells Which Were 2.79-28.46 % Higher Than That Of Native (Non-Adapted) Strains, Which Indicates The Significant Improvement In Xylose Transportation.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Identification and detoxification of glycolaldehyde, an unattended bioethanol fermentation inhibitor.

The Present Study Highlights The Development Of A Combined Pretreatment And Hydrolysis Strategy Of Rice Straw For The Production Of Bioethanol And Biopolymer (Poly-3-Hydroxybutyrate). Maximum Reducing Sugar Yield Was 0.374G/G. The Hydrolyzate Is Devoid Of Major Fermentation Inhibitors Like Furfural And Organic Acids And Can Be Used For Fermentation Without Any Detoxification. Fermentation Of The Non-Detoxified Hydrolyzate With Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Yielded 1.48% Of Ethanol With A Fermentation Efficiency Of 61.25% And With Comamonas Sp. Yielded 35.86% Of Poly-3-Hydroxybutyrate Without Any Nutrient Supplementation. Characterization Of Native, Control As Well As The Residue Left Out After Combined Pretreatment And Hydrolysis Of Rs By Scanning Electron Microscopy And X-Ray Diffraction Showed Difference. Compositional Analysis Revealed That The Residue Contains Lignin And Hemicellulose As The Major Component Indicating That Major Portion Of Cellulose Were Hydrolyzed In This Strategy.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Co-fermentation of acetate and sugars facilitating microbial lipid production on acetate-rich biomass hydrolysates. The Process Of Lignocellulosic Biomass Routinely Produces A Stream That Contains Sugars Plus Various Amounts Of Acetic Acid. As Acetate Is Known To Inhibit The Culture Of Microorganisms Including Oleaginous Yeasts, Little Attention Has Been Paid To Explore Lipid Production On Mixtures Of Acetate And Sugars. Here We Demonstrated That The Yeast Cryptococcus Curvatus Can Effectively Co-Ferment Acetate And Sugars For Lipid Production. When Mixtures Of Acetate And Glucose Were Applied, C. Curvatus Consumed Both Substrates Simultaneously. Similar Phenomena Were Also Observed For Acetate And Xylose Mixtures, As Well As Acetate-Rich Corn Stover Hydrolysates. More Interestingly, The Replacement Of Sugar With Equal Amount Of Acetate As Carbon Source Afforded Higher Lipid Titre And Lipid Content. The Lipid Products Had Fatty Acid Compositional Profiles Similar To Those Of Cocoa Butter, Suggesting Their Potential For High Value-Added Fats And Biodiesel Production. This Co-Fermentation Strategy Should Facilitate Lipid Production Technology From Lignocelluloses.

The Large Water Consumption (1.9-5.9 M(3) Water Per M(3) Of Biofuel) Required By Biomass Processing Plants Has Become An Emerging Concern, Which Is Particularly Critical In Arid/Semiarid Regions. Seawater, As A Widely Available Water Source, Could Be An Interesting Option. This Work Was To Study The Technical Feasibility Of Using Seawater To Replace Freshwater In The Pretreatment Of Date Palm Leaflets, A Lignocellulosic Biomass From Arid Regions, For Bioethanol Production. It Was Shown That Leaflets Pretreated With Seawater Exhibited Lower Cellulose Crystallinity Than Those Pretreated With Freshwater. Pretreatment With Seawater Produced Comparably Digestible And Fermentable Solids To Those Obtained With Freshwater. Moreover, No Significant Difference Of Inhibition To Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Was Observed Between Liquids From Pretreatment With Seawater And Freshwater. The Results Showed That Seawater Could Be A Promising Alternative To Freshwater For Lignocellulose Biorefineries In Coastal And/Or Arid/Semiarid Areas.

Dextrose Fermentation By A Natural Isolate, Mtcc4780, Under Semi-Anaerobic Conditions Produced Maximum Ethanol Yields Of 0.44 G/G And 0.39 G/G, Respectively, With And Without The Stresses Encountered During Lignocellulosic Ethanol Fermentation. However, Mtcc4780 Produced Ethanol Yields Of 0.48 G/G, 0.42 G/G And 0.45 G/G, Respectively, With Glucose, Rice And Wheat Straw Enzymatic Hydrolysate Fermentation In A Bioreactor. The Isolates Mtcc4781 And Mtcc4796 Showed Higher Growth And Fermentation Performance Than Did Mtcc4780 In The Presence Of Elevated Temperature And Pre-Treatment Inhibitors. Taken Together, The Mtcc4780, Mtcc4781 And Mtcc4796 Strains Have The Potential To Serve As A Platform For Lignocellulosic Ethanol Production Under Stresses Associated With Second-Generation Biofuel Production.

This Study Established A New More Neutral Magnesium Bisulfate Pretreatment (Mbsp) Using Magnesium Bisulfate As Sulfonating Agent For Improving The Enzymatic Hydrolysis Efficiency Of Corn Stover. Using The Mbsp With 5.21% Magnesium Bisulfate, 170°C And Ph 5.2 For 60 Min, About 90% Of Lignin And 80% Of Hemicellulose Were Removed From Biomass And More Than 90% Cellulose Conversion Of Substrate Was Achieved After 48 H Hydrolysis. About 6.19 Kg Raw Corn Stover Could Produce 1 Kg Ethanol By Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Meanwhile, Mbsp Also Could Protect Sugars From Excessive Degradation, Prevent Fermentation Inhibition Formation And Directly Convert The Hemicelluloses Into Xylooligosaccharides As Higher-Value Products.

Concerns About Greenhouse Gas Emissions Have Increased Research Efforts Into Alternatives In Bio-Based Processes. With Regard To Transport Fuel, Bioethanol And Biodiesel Are Still The Main Biofuels Used. It Is Expected That Future Production Of These Biofuels Will Be Based On Processes Using Either Non-Food Competing Biomasses, Or Characterised By Low Co₂ Emissions. Many Microorganisms, Such As Microalgae, Yeast, Bacteria And Fungi, Have The Ability To Accumulate Oils Under Special Culture Conditions. Microbial Oils Might Become One Of The Potential Feed-Stocks For Biodiesel Production In The Near Future. The Use Of These Oils Is Currently Under Extensive Research In Order To Reduce Production Costs Associated With The Fermentation Process, Which Is A Crucial Factor To Increase Economic Feasibility.

cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	ChiNet uncovers rewired transcription subnetworks in tolerant yeast for advanced biofuels conversion. Analysis Of Rewired Upstream Subnetworks Impacting Downstream Differential Gene Expression Aids The Delineation Of Evolving Molecular Mechanisms. Cumulative Statistics Based On Conventional Differential Correlation Are Limited For Subnetwork Rewiring Analysis Since Rewiring Is Not Necessarily Equivalent To Change In Correlation Coefficients. Here We Present A Computational Method Chinet To Quantify Subnetwork Rewiring By Statistical Heterogeneity That Enables Detection Of Potential Genotype Changes Causing Altered Transcription Regulation In Evolving Organisms. Given A Differentially Expressed Downstream Gene Set, Chinet Backtracks A Rewired Upstream Subnetwork From A Super-Network Including Gene Interactions Known To Occur Under Various Molecular Contexts. We Benchmarked Chinet For Its High Accuracy In Distinguishing Rewired Artificial Subnetworks, In Silico Yeast Transcription-Metabolic Subnetworks, And Rewired Transcription Subnetworks For Candida Albicans Versus Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Against Two Differential-Correlation Based Subnetwork Rewiring Approaches. Then, Using Transcriptome Data From Tolerant S. Cerevisiae Strain Nrrl Y-50049 And A Wild-Type Intolerant Strain, Chinet Identified 44 Metabolic Pathways Affected By Rewired Transcription Subnetworks Anchored To Major Adaptively Activated Transcription Factor Genes Yap1, Rpn4, Sfp1 And Rox1, In Response To Toxic Chemical Challenges Involved In Lignocellulose-To-Biofuels Conversion. These Findings Support The Use Of Chinet In Rewiring Analysis Of Subnetworks Where Differential Interaction Patterns Resulting From Divergent Nonlinear Dynamics Abound.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Dynamic flux balancing elucidates NAD(P)H production as limiting response to furfural inhibition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Achieving Efficient And Economical Lignocellulose-Based Bioprocess Requires A Robust Organism Tolerant To Furfural, A Major Inhibitory Compound Present In Lignocellulosic Hydrolysate. The Aim Of This Study Was To Develop A Model That Could Generate Quantitative Descriptions Of Cell Metabolism For Elucidating The Cell'S Adaptive Response To Furfural. Such A Modelling Tool Could Provide Strategies For The Design Of More Robust Cells. A Dynamic Flux Balance (Dfba) Model Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Was Created By Coupling A Kinetic Fermentation Model With A Previously Published Genome-Scale Stoichiometric Model. The Dfba Model Was Used For Studying Intracellular And Extracellular Flux Responses To Furfural Perturbations Under Steady State And Dynamic Conditions. The Predicted Effects Of Furfural On Dynamic Flux Profiles Agreed Well With Previously Published Experimental Results. The Model Showed That The Yeast Cell Adjusts Its Metabolism In Response To Furfural Challenge By Increasing Fluxes Through The Pentose Phosphate Pathway, Tca Cycle, And Proline And Serine Biosynthesis In Order To Meet The High Demand Of Nad(P)H Cofactors. The Model Described Here Can Be Used To Aid In Systematic Optimization Of The Yeast, As Well As Of The Fermentation Process, For Efficient Lignocellulosic Ethanol Production.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Mutagenesis of Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I: impact of expression host on activity and stability at elevated temperatures. Trichoderma Reesei Is A Key Cellulase Source For Economically Saccharifying Cellulosic Biomass For The Production Of Biofuels. Lignocellulose Hydrolysis At Temperatures Above The Optimum Temperature Of T. Reesei Cellulases (~50°C) Could Provide Many Significant Advantages, Including Reduced Viscosity At High-Solids Loadings, Lower Risk Of Microbial Contamination During Saccharification, Greater Compatibility With High-Temperature Biomass Pretreatment, And Faster Rates Of Hydrolysis. These Potential Advantages Motivate Efforts To Engineer T. Reesei Cellulases That Can Hydrolyze Lignocellulose At Temperatures Ranging From 60-70°C.A B-Factor Guided Approach For Improving Thermostability Was Used To Engineer Variants Of Endoglucanase I (Cel7B) From T. Reesei (Tregi) That Are Able To Hydrolyze Cellulosic Substrates More Rapidly Than The Recombinant Wild-Type Tregi At Temperatures Ranging From 50-70°C. When Expressed In T.

Reesei Host) Wild-Type Tregi (T1/2 = 74 Hr At 60°C, Tr_Tregi). Furthermore, G230A/D113S/D115T Tr_Tregi Showed 2-Fold Improved Activity Compared To Tr_Tregi At 65°C On Solid Cellulosic Substrates, And Was As Efficient In Hydrolyzing Cellulose At 60°C As Tr_Tregi Was At 50°C. The Activities And Stabilities Of The Recombinant Tregi Enzymes Followed Similar Trends But Differed Significantly In Magnitude Depending On The Expression Host (Escherichia Coli Cell-Free, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, Neurospora Crassa, Or T. Reesei). Compared To N.Crassa-Expressed Tregi, S. Cerevisiae-Expressed Tregi Showed Inferior Activity And Stability, Which Was Attributed To The Lack Of Cyclization Of The N-Terminal Glutamine In Sc_Tregi And Not To Differences In Glycosylation. N-Terminal Pyroglutamate Formation In Tregi Expressed In S. Cerevisiae Was Found To Be Essential In Elevating Its Activity And Stability To Levels Similar To The T. Reesei Or N. Crassa-Expressed Enzyme, Highlighting The Importance Of This Ubiquitous Modification In Gh7 Enzymes.Structure-Guided Evolution Of T. Reesei Egi Was Used To Engineer Enzymes With Increased Thermal Stability And Activity On Solid Cellulosic Substrates. Production Of Tregi Enzymes In Four Hosts Highlighted The Impact Of The Expression Host And The Role Of N-Terminal Pyroglutamate Formation On The Activity And Stability Of Tregi Enzymes.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Plant-derived antifungal agent poacic acid targets β-1,3-glucan. A Rise In Resistance To Current Antifungals Necessitates Strategies To Identify Alternative Sources Of Effective Fungicides. We Report The Discovery Of Poacic Acid, A Potent Antifungal Compound Found In Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates Of Grasses. Chemical Genomics Using Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Showed That Loss Of Cell Wall Synthesis And Maintenance Genes Conferred Increased Sensitivity To Poacic Acid. Morphological Analysis Revealed That Cells Treated With Poacic Acid Behaved Similarly To Cells Treated With Other Cell Wall-Targeting Drugs And Mutants With Deletions In Genes Involved In Processes Related To Cell Wall Biogenesis. Poacic Acid Causes Rapid Cell Lysis And Is Synergistic With Caspofungin And Fluconazole. The Cellular Target Was Identified; Poacic Acid Localized To The Cell Wall And Inhibited Β-1,3-Glucan Synthesis In Vivo And In Vitro, Apparently By Directly Binding Β-1,3-Glucan. Through Its Activity On The Glucan Layer, Poacic Acid Inhibits Growth Of The Fungi Sclerotinia Sclerotiorum And Alternaria Solani As Well As The Oomycete Phytophthora Sojae. A Single Application Of Poacic Acid To Leaves Infected With The Broad-Range Fungal Pathogen S. Sclerotiorum Substantially Reduced Lesion Development. The Discovery Of Poacic Acid As A Natural Antifungal Agent Targeting Β-1,3-Glucan Highlights The Potential Side Use Of Products Generated In The Processing Of Renewable Biomass Toward Biofuels As A Source Of Valuable Bioactive Compounds And Further Clarifies The Nature And Mechanism Of Fermentation Inhibitors Found In Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Enhanced tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to multiple lignocellulose-derived inhibitors through modulation of spermidine contents. Fermentation Inhibitors Present In Lignocellulose Hydrolysates Are Inevitable Obstacles For Achieving Economic Production Of Biofuels And Biochemicals By Industrial Microorganisms. Here We Show That Spermidine (Spd) Functions As A Chemical Elicitor For Enhanced Tolerance Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Against Major Fermentation Inhibitors. In Addition, The Feasibility Of Constructing An Engineered S. Cerevisiae Strain Capable Of Tolerating Toxic Levels Of The Major Inhibitors Without Exogenous Addition Of Spd Was Explored. Specifically, We Altered Expression Levels Of The Genes In The Spd Biosynthetic Pathway. Also, Oaz1 Coding For Ornithine Decarboxylase (Odc) Antizyme And Tpo1 Coding For The Polyamine Transport Protein Were Disrupted To Increase Intracellular Spd Levels Through Alleviation Of Feedback Inhibition On Odc And Prevention Of Spd Excretion, Respectively. Especially, The Strain With Combination Of Oaz1 And Tpo1 Double Disruption And Overexpression Of Spe3 Not Only Contained Spermidine Content Of 1.1Mg Spd/G Cell, Which Was 171% Higher Than That Of The Control Strain, But Also Exhibited 60% And 33% Shorter Lag-Phase Period Than That Of The Control Strain Under The Medium Containing Furan Derivatives And Acetic Acid, Respectively. While We Observed A Positive Correlation Between Intracellular Spd Contents And Tolerance Phenotypes Among The Engineered Strains Accumulating Different Amounts Of Intracellular Spd, Too Much Spd Accumulation Is Likely To Cause Metabolic Burden. Therefore, Genetic Perturbations For Intracellular Spd Levels Should Be Optimized In Terms Of Metabolic Burden And Spd Contents To Construct Inhibitor Tolerant Yeast Strains. We Also Found That The Genes Involved In Purine Biosynthesis And Cell Wall And Chromatin Stability Were Related To The Enhanced Tolerance Phenotypes To Furfural. The Robust Strains Constructed In This Study Can Be Applied For Producing Chemicals And Advanced Biofuels From Cellulosic Hydrolysates.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Direct enzyme assay evidence confirms aldehyde reductase function of Ydr541cp and Ygl039wp from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Aldehyde Reductase Gene Ari1 Is A Recently Characterized Member Of An Intermediate Subfamily Within The Short-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase (Sdr) Superfamily That Clarified Mechanisms Of In Situ Detoxification Of 2-Furaldehyde And 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-Furaldehyde By Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Uncharacterized Open Reading Frames (Orfs) Are Common Among Tolerant Candidate Genes Identified For Lignocellulose-To-Advanced Biofuels Conversion. This Study Presents Partially Purified Proteins Of Two Orfs, Ydr541C And Ygl039W, And Direct Enzyme Assay Evidence Against Aldehyde-Inhibitory Compounds Commonly Encountered During Lignocellulosic Biomass Fermentation Processes. Each Of The Partially Purified Proteins Encoded By These Orfs Showed A Molecular Mass Of Approximately 38 Kda, Similar To Ari1P, A Protein Encoded By Aldehyde Reductase Gene. Both Proteins Demonstrated Strong Aldehyde Reduction Activities Toward 14 Aldehyde Substrates, With High Levels Of Reduction Activity For Ydr541Cp Toward Both Aromatic And Aliphatic Aldehydes. While Ydr541Cp Was Observed To Have A Significantly Higher Specific Enzyme Activity At 20 U/Mg Using Co-Factor Nadph, Ygl039Wp Displayed A Nadh Preference At 25 U/Mg In Reduction Of Butylaldehyde. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis Identified A Characteristic Catalytic Triad, Ser, Tyr And Lys; A Conserved Catalytic Motif Of Tyr-X-X-X-Lys; And A Cofactor-Binding Sequence Motif, Gly-X-X-Gly-X-X-Ala, Near The N-Terminus That Are Shared By Ydr541Cp, Ygl039Wp, Yol151Wp/Gre2 And Ari1P. Findings Of Aldehyde Reductase Genes Contribute To The Yeast Gene Annotation And Aids Development Of The Next-Generation Biocatalyst For Advanced Biofuels Production.

In This Study, We Integrated The Fermentation Pathways Of Both Hexose And Pentose Sugars And An Acetic Acid Reduction Pathway Into One Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Strain For The First Time Using Synthetic Biology And Metabolic Engineering Approaches. The Engineered Strain Coutilized Cellobiose, Xylose, And Acetic Acid To Produce Ethanol With A Substantially Higher Yield And Productivity Than The Control Strains, And The Results Showed The Unique Synergistic Effects Of Pathway Coexpression. The Mixed Substrate Coutilization Strategy Is Important For Making Complete And Efficient Use Of Cellulosic Carbon And Will Contribute To The Development Of Consolidated Bioprocessing For Cellulosic Biofuel. The Study Also Presents An Innovative Metabolic Engineering Approach Whereby Multiple Substrate Consumption Pathways Can Be Integrated In A Synergistic Way For Enhanced Bioconversion.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Xylose fermentation as a challenge for commercialization of lignocellulosic fuels and chemicals. Fuel Ethanol Production From Lignocellulosic Materials Is At A Level Where Commercial Biofuel Production Is Becoming A Reality. The Solubilization Of The Hemicellulose Fraction In Lignocellulosic-Based Feedstocks Results In A Large Variety Of Sugar Mixtures Including Xylose. However, Allowing Xylose Fermentation In Yeast That Normally Is Used For Fuel Ethanol Production Requires Genetic Engineering. Moreover, The Efficiency Of Lignocellulosic Pretreatment, Together With The Release And Generation Of Inhibitory Compounds In This Step, Are Some Of The New Challenges Faced During Second Generation Ethanol Production. Successful Advances In All These Aspects Will Improve Ethanol Yield, Productivity And Titer, Which Will Reduce The Impact On Capital And Operating Costs, Leading To The Consolidation Of The Fermentation Of Lignocellulosic Biomass As An Economically Feasible Option For The Production Of Renewable Fuels. Therefore The Development Of Yeast Strains Capable Of Fermenting A Wide Variety Of Sugars In A Highly Inhibitory Environment, While Maintaining A High Ethanol Yield And Production Rate, Is Required. This Review Provides An Overview Of The Current Status In The Use Of Xylose-Engineered Yeast Strains And Describes The Remaining Challenges To Achieve An Efficient Deployment Of Lignocellulosic-Based Ethanol Production.

Present Study Has Focused On Optimization Of Different Physicochemical Parameters For Production Of Thermostable Cellulases And Xylanase By Thermoascus Aurantiacus Rckk Under Ssf. Enzyme Production Was Supported Maximally On Wheat Bran Fed With 20% Inoculum, At Initial Ph 5, Temperature 45 °C And Moisture Ratio 1:3. The Supplementation Of Wheat Bran With Yeast Extract, Tween-80 And Glycine Further Improved Enzyme Titres (Cmcase 88 Iu/G, Fpase 15.8 Iu/G, Β-Glucosidase 25.3 Iu/G And Xylanase 6,543 Iu/G). The Crude Enzymes Hydrolyzed Phosphoric Acid-Swollen Wheat Straw, Avicel And Untreated Xylan Up To 74, 71 And 90%, Respectively. In Addition, T.

cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Assessing the potential of wild yeasts for bioethanol production. Bioethanol Fermentations Expose Yeasts To A New, Complex And Challenging Fermentation Medium With Specific Inhibitors And Sugar Mixtures Depending On The Type Of Carbon Source. It Is, Therefore, Suggested That The Natural Diversity Of Yeasts Should Be Further Exploited In Order To Find Yeasts With Good Ethanol Yield In Stressed Fermentation Media. In This Study, We Screened More Than 50 Yeast Isolates Of Which We Selected Five Isolates With Promising Features. The Species Candida Bombi, Wickerhamomyces Anomalus And Torulaspora Delbrueckii Showed Better Osmo- And Hydroxymethylfurfural Tolerance Than Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. However, S. Cerevisiae Isolates Had The Highest Ethanol Yield In Fermentation Experiments Mimicking High Gravity Fermentations (25 % Glucose) And Artificial Lignocellulose Hydrolysates (With A Myriad Of Inhibitors). Interestingly, Among Two Tested S. Cerevisiae Strains, A Wild Strain Isolated From An Oak Tree Performed Better Than Ethanol Red, A S. Cerevisiae Strain Which Is Currently Commonly Used In Industrial Bioethanol Fermentations. Additionally, A W. Anomalus Strain Isolated From Sugar Beet Thick Juice Was Found To Have A Comparable Ethanol Yield, But Needed Longer Fermentation Time. Other Non-Saccharomyces Yeasts Yielded Lower Ethanol Amounts.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	A synergistic effect of pretreatment on cell wall structural changes in barley straw (Hordeum vulgare L.) for efficient bioethanol production. Barley Straw (Hordeum Vulgare L.) Is An Attractive Lignocellulosic Material And One Of The Most Abundant Renewable Resources For Fuel Ethanol Production. Although It Has High Cellulose And Hemicellulose Contents, There Are Several Challenges And Limitations In The Process Of Converting It To Fuel Ethanol. High Ash, Silica And Lignin Contents In Barley Straw Make It An Inferior Feedstock For Enzymatic Hydrolysis. Therefore Pretreatment Of Barley Straw Could Play An Important Role In Inducing Structural And Compositional Changes That Increase The Efficiency Of Enzymatic Hydrolysis And Make The Whole Process Economically Viable.Saccharification Was Enhanced Using Various Concentrations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 And 3.0% V/V) Of A Solution Of Sodium Hypochlorite (Naclo) And Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂) And Various Reaction Times (15, 30 And 45 Min) During Pretreatment At 121 °C. The Highest Yield Of Glucose (447 Mg G⁻¹) Was Achieved By Pretreatment With 2.0% Naclo+H₂O₂ Solution For 30 Min, Representing An Increase Of 65.99% Compared With Untreated Barley Straw (152 Mg G⁻¹). During Fermentation, The Highest Amount Of Ethanol (207 Mg G⁻¹) Was Obtained Under Anaerobic Plus 0.4 Mmol L⁻¹ Benzoic Acid Conditions, Representing An Increase Of 57.49, 38.16 And 10.14% Compared With Untreated Sample (88 Mg G⁻¹), Aerobic (128 Mg G⁻¹) And Anaerobic (186 Mg G⁻¹) Conditions Respectively.The Results Suggest That Pretreatment With 2.0% Naclo+H₂O₂ Solution Disrupted The Recalcitrant Structure Of Barley Straw And Enhanced The Glucose Yield And Subsequent Bioethanol Production.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Yeast tolerance to the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. Lignocellulosic Plant Biomass Is The Target Feedstock For Production Of Second-Generation Biofuels. Ionic Liquid (Il) Pretreatment Can Enhance Deconstruction Of Lignocellulosic Biomass Into Sugars That Can Be Fermented To Ethanol. Although Biomass Is Typically Washed Following Il Pretreatment, Small Quantities Of Residual Il Can Inhibit Fermentative Microorganisms Downstream, Such As The Widely Used Ethanologenic Yeast, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. The Aim Of This Study Was To Identify Yeasts Tolerant To The Il 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium Acetate, One Of The Top Performing Ils Known For Biomass Pretreatment. One Hundred And Sixty Eight Strains Spanning The Ascomycota And Basidiomycota Phyla Were Selected For Screening, With Emphasis On Yeasts Within Or Closely Related To The Saccharomyces Genus And Those Tolerant To Saline Environments. Based On Growth In Media Containing 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium Acetate, Tolerance To Il Levels Ranging 1-5% Was Observed For 80 Strains. The Effect Of 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium Acetate Concentration On Maximum Cell Density And Growth Rate Was Quantified To Rank Tolerance. The Most Tolerant Yeasts Included Strains From The Genera Clavispora, Debaryomyces, Galactomyces, Hyphopichia, Kazachstania, Meyerozyma, Naumovozyma, Wickerhamomyces, Yarrowia, And Zygoascus. These Yeasts Included Species Known To Degrade Plant Cell Wall Polysaccharides And Those Capable Of Ethanol Fermentation. These Yeasts Warrant Further Investigation For Use In Saccharification And Fermentation Of Il-Pretreated Lignocellulosic Biomass To Ethanol Or Other Products.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Genomic and transcriptome analyses reveal that MAPK- and phosphatidylinositol-signaling pathways mediate tolerance to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde for industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Industrial Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Is A Traditional Ethanologenic Agent And A Promising Biocatalyst For Advanced Biofuels Production Using Lignocellulose Materials. Here We Present The Genomic Background Of Type Strain Nrrl Y-12632 And Its Transcriptomic Response To 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-Furaldehyde (Hmf), A Commonly Encountered Toxic Compound Liberated From Lignocellulosic-Biomass Pretreatment, In Dissecting The Genomic Mechanisms Of Yeast Tolerance. Compared With The Genome Of Laboratory Model Strain S288C, We Identified More Than 32,000 Snps In Y-12632 With 23,000 Missense And Nonsense Snps. Enriched Sequence Mutations Occurred For Genes Involved In Mapk- And Phosphatidylinositol (Pi)- Signaling Pathways In Strain Y-12632, With 41 And 13 Genes Containing Non-Synonymous Snps, Respectively. Many Of These Mutated Genes Displayed Consistent Up-Regulated Signature Expressions In Response To Challenges Of 30 Mm Hmf. Analogous Single-Gene Deletion Mutations Of These Genes Showed Significantly Sensitive Growth Response On A Synthetic Medium Containing 20 Mm Hmf. Our Results Suggest At Least Three Mapk-Signaling Pathways, Especially For The Cell-Wall Integrity Pathway, And Pi-Signaling Pathways To Be Involved In Mediation Of Yeast Tolerance Against Hmf In Industrial Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Higher Levels Of Sequence Variations Were Also Observed For Genes Involved In Purine And Pyrimidine Metabolism Pathways.

Finally, The Productivity And Economics Of The Designed Processes Were Compared.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Monitoring lignocellulosic bioethanol production processes using Raman spectroscopy. Process Control Automation In The Emerging Biorefinery Industry May Be Achieved By Applying Effective Methods For Monitoring Compound Concentrations During The Production Processes. This Study Examines The Application Of Raman Spectroscopy With An Excitation Wavelength Of 785Nm And An Immersion Probe For In Situ Monitoring The Progression Of Pretreatment, Hydrolysis And Fermentation Processes In The Production Of Lignocellulosic Ethanol. Raman Signals Were Attenuated By Light Scattering Cells And Lignocellulosic Particulates, Which The Quantification Method To Some Degree Could Correct For By Using An Internal Standard In The Spectra. Allowing Particulates To Settle By Using A Slow Stirring Speed Further Improved Results, Suggesting That Raman Spectroscopy Should Be Used In Combination With Continuous Separation When Used To Monitor Process Mixtures With Large Amounts Of Particulates. The Root Mean Square Error Of Prediction (Rmse) Of Ethanol And Glucose Measured In Real-Time Was Determined To Be 0.98G/L And 1.91G/L Respectively.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Engineering and two-stage evolution of a lignocellulosic hydrolysate-tolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain for anaerobic fermentation of xylose from AFEX pretreated corn stover. The Inability Of The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae To Ferment Xylose Effectively Under Anaerobic Conditions Is A Major Barrier To Economical Production Of Lignocellulosic Biofuels. Although Genetic Approaches Have Enabled Engineering Of S. Cerevisiae To Convert Xylose Efficiently Into Ethanol In Defined Lab Medium, Few Strains Are Able To Ferment Xylose From Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates In The Absence Of Oxygen. This Limited Xylose Conversion Is Believed To Result From Small Molecules Generated During Biomass Pretreatment And Hydrolysis, Which Induce Cellular Stress And Impair Metabolism. Here, We Describe The Development Of A Xylose-Fermenting S. Cerevisiae Strain With Tolerance To A Range Of Pretreated And Hydrolyzed Lignocellulose, Including Ammonia Fiber Expansion (Afex)-Pretreated Corn Stover Hydrolysate (Acsh). We Genetically Engineered A Hydrolysate-Resistant Yeast Strain With Bacterial Xylose Isomerase And Then Applied Two Separate Stages Of Aerobic And Anaerobic Directed Evolution. The Emergent S. Cerevisiae Strain Rapidly Converted Xylose From Lab Medium And Acsh To Ethanol Under Strict Anaerobic Conditions. Metabolomic, Genetic And Biochemical Analyses Suggested That A Missense Mutation In Gre3, Which Was Acquired During The Anaerobic Evolution, Contributed Toward Improved Xylose Conversion By Reducing Intracellular Production Of Xylitol, An Inhibitor Of Xylose Isomerase. These Results Validate Our Combinatorial Approach, Which Utilized Phenotypic Strain Selection, Rational Engineering And Directed Evolution For The Generation Of A Robust S. Cerevisiae Strain With The Ability To Ferment Xylose Anaerobically From Acsh.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Phylogeny in defining model plants for lignocellulosic ethanol production: a comparative study of Brachypodium distachyon, wheat, maize, and Miscanthus x giganteus leaf and stem biomass. The Production Of Ethanol From Pretreated Plant Biomass During Fermentation Is A Strategy To Mitigate Climate Change By Substituting Fossil Fuels. However, Biomass Conversion Is Mainly Limited By The Recalcitrant Nature Of The Plant Cell Wall. To Overcome Recalcitrance, The Optimization Of The Plant Cell Wall For Subsequent Processing Is A Promising Approach. Based On Their Phylogenetic Proximity To Existing And Emerging Energy Crops, Model Plants Have Been Proposed To Study Bioenergy-Related Cell Wall Biochemistry. One Example Is Brachypodium Distachyon, Which Has Been Considered As A General Model Plant For Cell Wall Analysis In Grasses. To Test Whether Relative Phylogenetic Proximity Would Be Sufficient To Qualify As A Model Plant Not Only For Cell Wall Composition But Also For The Complete Process Leading To Bioethanol Production, We Compared The Processing Of Leaf And Stem Biomass From The C3 Grasses B. Distachyon And Triticum Aestivum (Wheat) With The C4 Grasses Zea Mays (Maize) And Miscanthus X Giganteus, A Perennial Energy Crop. Lambda Scanning With A Confocal Laser-Scanning Microscope Allowed A Rapid Qualitative Analysis Of Biomass Saccharification. A Maximum Of 108-117 Mg Ethanol·G(-1) Dry Biomass Was Yielded From Thermo-Chemically And Enzymatically Pretreated Stem Biomass Of The Tested Plant Species. Principal Component Analysis Revealed That A Relatively Strong Correlation Between Similarities In Lignocellulosic Ethanol Production And Phylogenetic Relation Was Only Given For Stem And Leaf Biomass Of The Two Tested C4 Grasses. Our Results Suggest That Suitability Of B. Distachyon As A Model Plant For Biomass Conversion Of Energy Crops Has To Be Specifically Tested Based On Applied Processing Parameters And Biomass Tissue Type.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Sugar-rich sweet sorghum is distinctively affected by wall polymer features for biomass digestibility and ethanol fermentation in bagasse. Sweet Sorghum Has Been Regarded As A Typical Species For Rich Soluble-Sugar And High Lignocellulose Residues, But Their Effects On Biomass Digestibility Remain Unclear. In This Study, We Examined Total 63 Representative Sweet Sorghum Accessions That Displayed A Varied Sugar Level At Stalk And Diverse Cell Wall Composition At Bagasse. Correlative Analysis Showed That Both Soluble-Sugar And Dry-Bagasse Could Not Significantly Affect Lignocellulose Saccharification Under Chemical Pretreatments. Comparative Analyses Of Five Typical Pairs Of Samples Indicated That Dp Of Crystalline Cellulose And Arabinose Substitution Degree Of Non-Koh-Extractable Hemicelluloses Distinctively Affected Lignocellulose Crystallinity For High Biomass Digestibility. By Comparison, Lignin Could Not Alter Lignocellulose Crystallinity, But The Koh-Extractable G-Monomer Predominately Determined Lignin Negative Impacts On Biomass Digestions, And The G-Levels Released From Pretreatments Significantly Inhibited Yeast Fermentation. The Results Also Suggested Potential Genetic Approaches For Enhancing Soluble-Sugar Level And Lignocellulose Digestibility And Reducing Ethanol Conversion Inhibition In Sweet Sorghum.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Employing a combinatorial expression approach to characterize xylose utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fermentation Of Xylose, A Major Constituent Of Lignocellulose, Will Be Important For Expanding Sustainable Biofuel Production. We Sought To Better Understand The Effects Of Intrinsic (Genotypic) And Extrinsic (Growth Conditions) Variables On Optimal Gene Expression Of The Scheffersomyces Stipitis Xylose Utilization Pathway In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae By Using A Set Of Five Promoters To Simultaneously Regulate Each Gene. Three-Gene (Xylose Reductase, Xylitol Dehydrogenase (Xdh), And Xylulokinase) And Eight-Gene (Expanded With Non-Oxidative Pentose Phosphate Pathway Enzymes And Pyruvate Kinase) Promoter Libraries Were Enriched Under Aerobic And Anaerobic Conditions Or With A Mutant Xdh With Altered Cofactor Usage. Through Characterization Of Enriched Strains, We Observed (1) Differences In Promoter Enrichment For The Three-Gene Library Depending On Whether The Pentose Phosphate Pathway Genes Were Included During The Aerobic Enrichment; (2) The Importance Of Selection Conditions, Where Some Aerobically-Enriched Strains Underperform In Anaerobic Conditions Compared To Anaerobically-Enriched Strains; (3) Improved Growth Rather Than Improved Fermentation Product Yields For Optimized Strains Carrying The Mutant Xdh Compared To The Wild-Type Xdh.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Combined process for ethanol fermentation at high-solids loading and biogas digestion from unwashed steam-exploded corn stover. A Combined Process Was Designed For The Co-Production Of Ethanol And Methane From Unwashed Steam-Exploded Corn Stover. A Terminal Ethanol Titer Of 69.8 G/Kg Mass Weight (72.5%) Was Achieved When The Fed-Batch Mode Was Performed At A Final Solids Loading Of 35.5% (W/W) Dry Matter (Dm) Content. The Whole Stillage From High-Solids Ethanol Fermentation Was Directly Transferred In A 3-L Anaerobic Digester. During 52-Day Single-Stage Digester Operation, The Methane Productivity Was 320 Ml Ch₄/G Volatile Solids (Vs) With A Maximum Vs Reduction Efficiency Of 55.3%. The Calculated Overall Product Yield Was 197 G Ethanol + 96 G Methane/Kg Corn Stover. This Indicated That The Combined Process Was Able To Improve Overall Content Utilization And Extract A Greater Yield Of Lignocellulosic Biomass Compared To Ethanol Fermentation Alone.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Expression and evaluation of enzymes required for the hydrolysis of galactomannan. The Cost-Effective Production Of Bioethanol From Lignocellulose Requires The Complete Conversion Of Plant Biomass, Which Contains Up To 30 % Mannan. To Ensure Utilisation Of Galactomannan During Consolidated Bioprocessing, Heterologous Production Of Mannan-Degrading Enzymes In Fungal Hosts Was Explored. The Aspergillus Aculeatus Endo-Β-Mannanase (Man1) And Talaromyces Emersonii Α-Galactosidase (Agal) Genes Were Expressed In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Y294, And The Aspergillus Niger Β-Mannosidase (Cmnda) And Synthetic Cellvibrio Mixtus Β-Mannosidase (Man5A) Genes In A. Niger. Maximum Enzyme Activity For Man1 (374 Nkat Ml(-1), Ph 5.47), Agal (135 Nkat Ml(-1), Ph 2.37), Cmnda (12 Nkat Ml(-1), Ph 3.40) And Man5A (8 Nkat Ml(-1), Ph 3.40) Was Observed Between 60 And 70 °C. Co-Expression Of The Man1 And Agal Genes In S. Cerevisiae Y294[Agal-Man1] Reduced The Extracellular Activity Relative To Individual Expression Of The Respective Genes. However, The Combined Action Of Crude Man1, Agal And Man5A Enzyme Preparations Significantly Decreased The Viscosity Of Galactomannan In Locust Bean Gum, Confirming Hydrolysis Thereof. Furthermore, When Complemented With Exogenous Man5A, S. Cerevisiae Y294[Agal-Man1] Produced 56 % Of The Theoretical Ethanol Yield, Corresponding To A 66 % Carbohydrate Conversion, On 5 G L(-1) Mannose And 10 G L(-1) Locust Bean Gum.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	An integrative process of bioconversion of oil palm empty fruit bunch fiber to ethanol with on-site cellulase production. The Aim Of This Study Was To Efficiently Convert Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch Fiber (Opefb), One Of The Most Commonly Generated Lingo-Wastes In Southeast Asia, Into Both Cellulase And Bioethanol. The Unprocessed Cellulase Crude (37.29%) Produced Under Solid-State Fermentation Using Opefb As Substrate Showed A Better Reducing Sugar Yield Using Filter Paper Than The Commercial Enzyme Blend (34.61%). Organosolv Pretreatment Method Could Efficiently Reduce Hemicellulose (24.3-18.6%) And Lignin (35.2-22.1%) Content And Increase Cellulose Content (40.5-59.3%) From Opefb. Enzymatic Hydrolysis Of Pretreated Opefb Using The Crude Cellulase With 20% Solid Content, Enzyme Loading Of 15 Fpu/G Opefb At 50 °C, And Ph 5.5 Resulted In A Opefb Hydrolysate Containing 36.01 G/L Glucose After 72 H. Fermentation Of The Hydrolysate Medium Produced 17.64 G/L Ethanol With 0.49 G/G Yield From Glucose And 0.088 G/G Yield From Opefb At 8 H Using Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Industrial robust yeast isolates with great potential for fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. The Search Of Robust Microorganisms Is Essential To Design Sustainable Processes Of Second Generation Bioethanol. Yeast Strains Isolated From Industrial Environments Are Generally Recognised To Present An Increased Stress Tolerance But No Specific Information Is Available On Their Tolerance Towards Inhibitors That Come From The Pretreatment Of Lignocellulosic Materials. In This Work, A Strategy For The Selection Of Different Yeasts Using Hydrothermal Hydrolysate From Eucalyptus Globulus Wood, Containing Different Concentrations Of Inhibitors, Was Developed. Ten Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Four Kluyveromyces Marxianus Strains Isolated From Industrial Environments And Four Laboratory Background Strains Were Evaluated. Interestingly, A Correlation Between Final Ethanol Titer And Percentage Of Furfural Detoxification Was Observed. The Results Presented Here Highlight Industrial Distillery Environments As A Remarkable Source Of Efficient Yeast Strains For Lignocellulosic Fermentation Processes. Selected Strains Were Able To Resourcefully Degrade Furfural And Hmf Inhibitors, Producing 0.8G Ethanol/Lh Corresponding To 94% Of The Theoretical Yield.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Engineering microbial surfaces to degrade lignocellulosic biomass. Renewable Lignocellulosic Plant Biomass Is A Promising Feedstock From Which To Produce Biofuels, Chemicals, And Materials. One Approach To Cost-Effectively Exploit This Resource Is To Use Consolidating Bioprocessing (Cbp) Microbes That Directly Convert Lignocellulose Into Valuable End Products. Because Many Promising Cbp-Enabling Microbes Are Non-Cellulolytic, Recent Work Has Sought To Engineer Them To Display Multi-Cellulase Containing Minicellulosomes That Hydrolyze Biomass More Efficiently Than Isolated Enzymes. In This Review, We Discuss Progress In Engineering The Surfaces Of The Model Microorganisms: Bacillus Subtilis, Escherichia Coli, And Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We Compare The Distinct Approaches Used To Display Cellulases And Minicellulosomes, As Well As Their Surface Enzyme Densities And Cellulolytic Activities. Thus Far, Minicellulosomes Have Only Been Grafted Onto The Surfaces Of B. Subtilis And S. Cerevisiae, Suggesting That The Absence Of An Outer Membrane In Fungi And Gram-Positive Bacteria May Make Their Surfaces Better Suited For Displaying The Elaborate Multi-Enzyme Complexes Needed To Efficiently Degrade Lignocellulose.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Flocculating Zymomonas mobilis is a promising host to be engineered for fuel ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. Whereas Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Uses The Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas Pathway To Metabolize Glucose, Zymomonas Mobilis Uses The Entner-Doudoroff (Ed) Pathway. Employing The Ed Pathway, 50% Less Atp Is Produced, Which Could Lead To Less Biomass Being Accumulated During Fermentation And An Improved Yield Of Ethanol. Moreover, Z. Mobilis Cells, Which Have A High Specific Surface Area, Consume Glucose Faster Than S. Cerevisiae, Which Could Improve Ethanol Productivity. We Performed Ethanol Fermentations Using These Two Species Under Comparable Conditions To Validate These Speculations. Increases Of 3.5 And 3.3% In Ethanol Yield, And 58.1 And 77.8% In Ethanol Productivity, Were Observed In Ethanol Fermentations Using Z. Mobilis Zm4 In Media Containing ∼100 And 200 G/L Glucose, Respectively. Furthermore, Ethanol Fermentation Bythe Flocculating Z. Mobilis Zm401 Was Explored. Although No Significant Difference Was Observed In Ethanol Yield And Productivity, The Flocculation Of The Bacterial Species Enabled Biomass Recovery By Cost-Effective Sedimentation, Instead Of Centrifugation With Intensive Capital Investment And Energy Consumption. In Addition, Tolerance To Inhibitory Byproducts Released During Biomass Pretreatment, Particularly Acetic Acid And Vanillin, Was Improved. These Experimental Results Indicate That Z. Mobilis, Particularly Its Flocculating Strain, Is Superior To S. Cerevisiae As A Host To Be Engineered For Fuel Ethanol Production From Lignocellulosic Biomass.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Harnessing genetic diversity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for fermentation of xylose in hydrolysates of alkaline hydrogen peroxide-pretreated biomass. The Fermentation Of Lignocellulose-Derived Sugars, Particularly Xylose, Into Ethanol By The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Is Known To Be Inhibited By Compounds Produced During Feedstock Pretreatment. We Devised A Strategy That Combined Chemical Profiling Of Pretreated Feedstocks, High-Throughput Phenotyping Of Genetically Diverse S. Cerevisiae Strains Isolated From A Range Of Ecological Niches, And Directed Engineering And Evolution Against Identified Inhibitors To Produce Strains With Improved Fermentation Properties. We Identified And Quantified For The First Time The Major Inhibitory Compounds In Alkaline Hydrogen Peroxide (Ahp)-Pretreated Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates, Including Na(+), Acetate, And P-Coumaric (Pca) And Ferulic (Fa) Acids. By Phenotyping These Yeast Strains For Their Abilities To Grow In The Presence Of These Ahp Inhibitors, One Heterozygous Diploid Strain Tolerant To All Four Inhibitors Was Selected, Engineered For Xylose Metabolism, And Then Allowed To Evolve On Xylose With Increasing Amounts Of Pca And Fa. After Only 149 Generations, One Evolved Isolate, Glbrcy87, Exhibited Faster Xylose Uptake Rates In Both Laboratory Media And Ahp Switchgrass Hydrolysate Than Its Ancestral Glbrcy73 Strain And Completely Converted 115 G/Liter Of Total Sugars In Undetoxified Ahp Hydrolysate Into More Than 40 G/Liter Ethanol. Strikingly, Genome Sequencing Revealed That During The Evolution From Glbrcy73, The Glbrcy87 Strain Acquired The Conversion Of Heterozygous To Homozygous Alleles In Chromosome Vii And Amplification Of Chromosome Xiv. Our Approach Highlights That Simultaneous Selection On Xylose And Pca Or Fa With A Wild S. Cerevisiae Strain Containing Inherent Tolerance To Ahp Pretreatment Inhibitors Has Potential For Rapid Evolution Of Robust Properties In Lignocellulosic Biofuel Production.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Engineering yeast hexokinase 2 for improved tolerance toward xylose-induced inactivation. Hexokinase 2 (Hxk2P) From Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Is A Bi-Functional Enzyme Being Both A Catalyst And An Important Regulator In The Glucose Repression Signal. In The Presence Of Xylose Hxk2P Is Irreversibly Inactivated Through An Autophosphorylation Mechanism, Affecting All Functions. Consequently, The Regulation Of Genes Involved In Sugar Transport And Fermentative Metabolism Is Impaired. The Aim Of The Study Was To Obtain New Hxk2P-Variants, Immune To The Autophosphorylation, Which Potentially Can Restore The Repressive Capability Closer To Its Nominal Level. In This Study We Constructed The First Condensed, Rationally Designed Combinatorial Library Targeting The Active-Site In Hxk2P. We Combined Protein Engineering And Genetic Engineering For Efficient Screening And Identified A Variant With Phe159 Changed To Tyrosine. This Variant Had 64% Higher Catalytic Activity In The Presence Of Xylose Compared To The Wild-Type And Is Expected To Be A Key Component For Increasing The Productivity Of Recombinant Xylose-Fermenting Strains For Bioethanol Production From Lignocellulosic Feedstocks.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	High β-glucosidase secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae improves the efficiency of cellulase hydrolysis and ethanol production in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Bioethanol Production From Lignocellulose Is Considered As A Sustainable Biofuel Supply. However, The Low Cellulose Hydrolysis Efficiency Limits The Cellulosic Ethanol Production. The Cellulase Is Strongly Inhibited By The Major End Product Cellobiose, Which Can Be Relieved By The Addition Of Β-Glucosidase. In This Study, Three Β-Glucosidases From Different Organisms Were Respectively Expressed In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And The Β-Glucosidase From Saccharomycopsis Fibuligera Showed The Best Activity (5.2 U/Ml). The Recombinant Strain With S. Fibuligera Β-Glucosidase Could Metabolize Cellobiose With A Specific Growth Rate Similar To The Control Strain In Glucose. This Recombinant Strain Showed Higher Hydrolysis Efficiency In The Cellulose Simultaneous Saccharification And Fermentation, When Using The Trichoderma Reesei Cellulase, Which Is Short Of The Β-Glucosidase Activity. The Final Ethanol Concentration Was 110% (Using Avicel) And 89% (Using Acid-Pretreated Corncob) Higher Than The Control Strain. These Results Demonstrated The Effect Of Β-Glucosidase Secretion In The Recombinant S. Cerevisiae For Enhancing Cellulosic Ethanol Conversion.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Co-expression of TAL1 and ADH1 in recombinant xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae improves ethanol production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates in the presence of furfural. Lignocellulosic Biomass Dedicated To Bioethanol Production Usually Contains Pentoses And Inhibitory Compounds Such As Furfural That Are Not Well Tolerated By Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Thus, S. Cerevisiae Strains With The Capability Of Utilizing Both Glucose And Xylose In The Presence Of Inhibitors Such As Furfural Are Very Important In Industrial Ethanol Production. Under The Synergistic Conditions Of Transaldolase (Tal) And Alcohol Dehydrogenase (Adh) Overexpression, S. Cerevisiae Mt8-1X/Tal-Adh Was Able To Produce 1.3-Fold And 2.3-Fold More Ethanol In The Presence Of 70 Mm Furfural Than A Tal-Expressing Strain And A Control Strain, Respectively. We Also Tested The Strains' Ability By Mimicking Industrial Ethanol Production From Hemicellulosic Hydrolysate Containing Fermentation Inhibitors, And Ethanol Production Was Further Improved By 16% When Using Mt8-1X/Tal-Adh Compared To The Control Strain. Transcript Analysis Further Revealed That Besides The Pentose Phosphate Pathway Genes Tkl1 And Tal1, Adh7 Was Also Upregulated In Response To Furfural Stress, Which Resulted In Higher Ethanol Production Compared To The Tal-Expressing Strain. The Improved Capability Of Our Modified Strain Was Based On Its Capacity To More Quickly Reduce Furfural In Situ Resulting In Higher Ethanol Production. The Co-Expression Of Tal/Adh Genes Is One Crucial Strategy To Fully Utilize Undetoxified Lignocellulosic Hydrolysate, Leading To Cost-Competitive Ethanol Production.

Under The Conditions, Efb Solid Recovery Was 74.09%, And Glucan, Xylan And Lignin Content Were 44.08%, 25.74% And 13.89%, Respectively. After Separated With Alkali Solution, The Pretreated Efb Was Washed And Hydrolyzed For 72 H With 5% Substrate Concentration And 30 Fpu/G Dry Mass (Dm) Enzyme Loading, And The Conversion Of Glucan And Xylan Reached 84.44% And 89.28%, Respectively. We Further Investigated The Effects Of Substrate Concentration And Enzyme Loading On Enzymatic Hydrolysis And Ethanol Batch Simultaneous Saccharification And Fermentation (Ssf). The Results Show That When Enzyme Loading Was 30 Fpu/G Dm And Substrate Concentration Was Increased From 5% To 25%, Ethanol Concentration Were 9.76 G/L And 35.25 G/L After 72 H Fermentation With Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Inoculum Size 5%, V/V), Which Was 79.09% And 56.96% Of Ethanol Theory Yield.

The Xylose-Rich Solution Was Used For Production Of Astaxanthin By The Yeast Phaffia Rhodozyma Without Further Treatment. The Resulting Cellulose-Enriched Solid Residue Was Used For Ethanol Production In A Fed-Batch Simultaneous Saccharification And Fermentation Using Accellerase® 1500 (A Commercial Cellulase Product) And The Industrial Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.

Vsg-1 Was Isolated From The Soil Sample And Characterized For The Production Of Lignocellulolytic Enzymes. Production Of These Enzymes By The Strain Vsg-1 Was Carried Out Using Steam-Exploded Sugarcane Bagasse (Scb) And Found To Secrete Cellulase, Pectinase, Mannanase, Xylanase, And Tannase. The Growth And Enzyme Production Were Found To Be Optimum At Ph 9.0 And 37 °C. Upon Steam Explosion Of Scb, The Cellulose Increased By 42 %, Whereas Hemicelluloses And Lignin Decreased By 40 And 62 %, Respectively.

The Alcohol Produced Was Calculated And Found To Be 62.24 G/L Corresponding To 78 % Of The Theoretical Yield Of Ethanol. Hence, The Strain Vsg-1 Has An Industrial Importance For The Production Of Fermentable Sugars For Biofuels.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Bioethanol production from Lignocellulosic biomass by a novel Kluyveromyces marxianus strain. The Yeast Kluyveromyces Marxianus Is Considered As A Potential Alternative To Saccharomyces Cerevisiae In Producing Ethanol As A Biofuel. In This Study, We Investigated The Ethanol Fermentation Properties Of Novel K. Marxianus Strain Dmb1, Isolated From Bagasse Hydrolysates. This Strain Utilized Sorbitol As Well As Various Pentoses And Hexoses As Single Carbon Sources Under Aerobic Conditions And Produced Ethanol From Glucose In Hydrolysates Of The Japanese Cedar At 42 °C. Reference Strains K. Marxianus Nbrc1777 And S. Cerevisiae By4743 Did Not Assimilate Sorbitol Or Ferment Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates To Ethanol At This Temperature. Thus Strain Dmb1 Appears To Be Optimal For Producing Bioethanol At High Temperatures, And Might Provide A Valuable Means Of Increasing The Efficiency Of Ethanol Fermentation.

cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Improvement of ethanol productivity and energy efficiency by degradation of inhibitors using recombinant Zymomonas mobilis (pHW20a-fdh). Toxic Compounds, Such As Formic Acid, Furfural, And Hydroxymethylfurfural (Hmf) Generated During Pretreatment Of Corn Stover (Cs) At High Temperature And Low Ph, Inhibit Growth Of Zymomonas Mobilis And Lower The Conversion Efficiency Of Cs To Biofuel And Other Products. The Inhibition Of Toxic Compounds Is Considered As One Of The Major Technical Barriers In The Lignocellulose Bioconversion. In Order To Detoxify And/Or Degrade These Toxic Compounds By The Model Ethanologenic Strain Z. Mobilis Itself In Situ The Fermentation Medium, We Constructed A Recombinant Z. Mobilis Zm4 (Phw20A-Fdh) Strain That Is Capable Of Degrading Toxic Inhibitor, Formate. This Is Accomplished By Cloning Heterologous Formate Dehydrogenase Gene (Fdh) From Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And By Coupling This Reaction Of Nadh Regeneration Reaction System With Furfural And Hmf Degradation In The Recombinant Z.

cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Endowing non-cellulolytic microorganisms with cellulolytic activity aiming for consolidated bioprocessing. With The Exhaustion Of Fossil Fuels And With The Environmental Issues They Pose, Utilization Of Abundant Lignocellulosic Biomass As A Feedstock For Biofuels And Bio-Based Chemicals Has Recently Become An Attractive Option. Lignocellulosic Biomass Is Primarily Composed Of Cellulose, Hemicellulose, And Lignin And Has A Very Rigid And Complex Structure. It Is Accordingly Much More Expensive To Process Than Starchy Grains Because Of The Need For Extensive Pretreatment And Relatively Large Amounts Of Cellulases For Efficient Hydrolysis. Efficient And Cost-Effective Methods For The Production Of Biofuels And Chemicals From Lignocellulose Are Required. A Consolidated Bioprocess (Cbp), Which Integrates All Biological Steps Consisting Of Enzyme Production, Saccharification, And Fermentation, Is Considered A Promising Strategy For Reducing Production Costs. Establishing An Efficient Cbp Using Lignocellulosic Biomass Requires Both Lignocellulose Degradation Into Glucose And Efficient Production Of Biofuels Or Chemicals From Glucose. With This Aim, Many Researchers Are Attempting To Endow Selected Microorganisms With Lignocellulose-Assimilating Ability. In This Review, We Focus On Studies Aimed At Conferring Lignocellulose-Assimilating Ability Not Only To Yeast Strains But Also To Bacterial Strains By Recombinant Technology. Recent Developments In Improvement Of Enzyme Productivity By Microorganisms And In Improvement Of The Specific Activity Of Cellulase Are Emphasized.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Simultaneous saccharification, filtration and fermentation (SSFF): a novel method for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. Simultaneous Saccharification, Filtration And Fermentation (Ssff) Was Developed For Lignocellulosic Ethanol Production. In Ssff, Pretreated Lignocellulosic Material Is Enzymatically Hydrolyzed In A Reactor, While The Suspension Is Continuously Pumped Through A Cross-Flow Membrane. The Retentate Goes Back To The Hydrolysis Vessel, While A Clear Sugar-Rich Filtrate Continuously Perfuses Through The Fermentation Vessel Before It Is Pumped Back To The Hydrolysis Vessel. The Capacity And Life Span Of The Cross-Flow Filter Module Was Examined For 4 Weeks Using Enzymatically Hydrolyzed Slurry, Initially With 14.4% Suspended Solids, Without Clogging Or Fouling. An Ethanol Yield Of 85.0% Of The Theoretical Yield Was Obtained In Ssff And A Flocculating Strain Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Was Successfully Reused For Five Cultivations Of Ssff.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Enhanced ethanol production from wheat straw by integrated storage and pre-treatment (ISP). Integrated Storage And Pre-Treatment (Isp) Combines Biopreservation Of Moist Material Under Airtight Conditions And Pre-Treatment. Moist Wheat Straw Was Inoculated With The Biocontrol Yeast Wickerhamomyces Anomalus, The Xylan Degrading Yeast Scheffersomyces Stipitis Or A Co-Culture Of Both. The Samples And Non-Inoculated Controls Were Stored At 4 Or 15 °C. The Non-Inoculated Controls Were Heavily Contaminated With Moulds, In Contrast To The Samples Inoculated With W. Anomalus Or S. Stipitis. These Two Yeasts Were Able To Grow On Wheat Straw As Sole Source Of Nutrients. When Ethanol Was Produced From Moist Wheat Straw Stored For Four Weeks At 4 °C With S. Stipitis, An Up To 40% Enhanced Yield (Final Yield 0.15 G Ethanol Per G Straw Dry Weight) Was Obtained Compared To A Dry Sample (0.107 G/G). In All Other Moist Samples, Stored For Four Weeks At 4 °C Or 15 °C, 6-35% Higher Yields Were Obtained. Thus, Energy Efficient Bio-Preservation Can Improve The Pre-Treatment Efficiency For Lignocellulose Biomass, Which Is A Critical Bottleneck In Its Conversion To Biofuels.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Encapsulation-induced stress helps Saccharomyces cerevisiae resist convertible Lignocellulose derived inhibitors. The Ability Of Macroencapsulated Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Cbs8066 To Withstand Readily And Not Readily In Situ Convertible Lignocellulose-Derived Inhibitors Was Investigated In Anaerobic Batch Cultivations. It Was Shown That Encapsulation Increased The Tolerance Against Readily Convertible Furan Aldehyde Inhibitors And To Dilute Acid Spruce Hydrolysate, But Not To Organic Acid Inhibitors That Cannot Be Metabolized Anaerobically. Gene Expression Analysis Showed That The Protective Effect Arising From The Encapsulation Is Evident Also On The Transcriptome Level, As The Expression Of The Stress-Related Genes Yap1, Atr1 And Flr1 Was Induced Upon Encapsulation. The Transcript Levels Were Increased Due To Encapsulation Already In The Medium Without Added Inhibitors, Indicating That The Cells Sensed Low Stress Level Arising From The Encapsulation Itself. We Present A Model, Where The Stress Response Is Induced By Nutrient Limitation, That This Helps The Cells To Cope With The Increased Stress Added By A Toxic Medium, And That Superficial Cells In The Capsules Degrade Convertible Inhibitors, Alleviating The Inhibition For The Cells Deeper In The Capsule.

The Technology Of Converting Lignocellulose To Biofuels Has Advanced Swiftly Over The Past Few Years, And Enzymes Are A Significant Constituent Of This Technology. In This Regard, Cost Effective Production Of Cellulases Has Been The Focus Of Research For Many Years. One Approach To Reach Cost Targets Of These Enzymes Involves The Use Of Plants As Bio-Factories. The Application Of This Technology To Plant Biomass Conversion For Biofuels And Biobased Products Has The Potential For Significantly Lowering The Cost Of These Products Due To Lower Enzyme Production Costs.

The Enzyme Is Active On Microcrystalline Cellulose As Exponential Microbial Growth Was Observed In The Mixture Of Cellulose, Cellulases, Yeast And Cel6A, Cel7A (Endoglucanase), And Cel5A (Cellobiohydrolase I) Expressed In Maize Seeds. We Quantify The Amount Accumulated And The Activity Of The Enzyme. Cel6A Expressed In Maize Endosperm Was Purified To Homogeneity And Verified Using Peptide Mass Finger Printing.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Novel strategies to improve co-fermentation of pentoses with D-glucose by recombinant yeast strains in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Economically Feasible Production Of Second-Generation Biofuels Requires Efficient Co-Fermentation Of Pentose And Hexose Sugars In Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates Under Very Harsh Conditions. Baker'S Yeast Is An Excellent, Traditionally Used Ethanol Producer But Is Naturally Not Able To Utilize Pentoses. This Is Due To The Lack Of Pentose-Specific Transporter Proteins And Enzymatic Reactions. Thus, Natural Yeast Strains Must Be Modified By Genetic Engineering. Although The Construction Of Various Recombinant Yeast Strains Able To Ferment Pentose Sugars Has Been Described During The Last Two Decades, Their Rates Of Pentose Utilization Is Still Significantly Lower Than D-Glucose Fermentation. Moreover, Pentoses Are Only Fermented After D-Glucose Is Exhausted, Resulting In An Uneconomical Increase In The Fermentation Time. In This Addendum, We Discuss Novel Approaches To Improve Utilization Of Pentoses By Development Of Specific Transporters And Substrate Channeling In Enzyme Cascades.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Understanding physiological responses to pre-treatment inhibitors in ethanologenic fermentations. Alcohol-Based Liquid Fuels Feature Significantly In The Political And Social Agendas Of Many Countries, Seeking Energy Sustainability. It Is Certain That Ethanol Will Be The Entry Point For Many Sustainable Processes. Conventional Ethanol Production Using Maize- And Sugarcane-Based Carbohydrates With Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Is Well Established, While Lignocellulose-Based Processes Are Receiving Growing Interest Despite Posing Greater Technical And Scientific Challenges. A Significant Challenge That Arises From The Chemical Hydrolysis Of Lignocellulose Is The Generation Of Toxic Compounds In Parallel With The Release Of Sugars. These Compounds, Collectively Termed Pre-Treatment Inhibitors, Impair Metabolic Functionality And Growth. Their Removal, Pre-Fermentation Or Their Abatement, Via Milder Hydrolysis, Are Currently Uneconomic Options. It Is Widely Acknowledged That A More Cost Effective Strategy Is To Develop Resistant Process Strains. Here We Describe And Classify Common Inhibitors And Describe In Detail The Reported Physiological Responses That Occur In Second-Generation Strains, Which Include Engineered Yeast And Mesophilic And Thermophilic Prokaryotes. It Is Suggested That A Thorough Understanding Of Tolerance To Common Pre-Treatment Inhibitors Should Be A Major Focus In Ongoing Strain Engineering. This Review Is A Useful Resource For Future Metabolic Engineering Strategies.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Designed for deconstruction--poplar trees altered in cell wall lignification improve the efficacy of bioethanol production. • There Is A Pressing Global Need To Reduce The Increasing Societal Reliance On Petroleum And To Develop A Bio-Based Economy. At The Forefront Is The Need To Establish A Sustainable, Renewable, Alternative Energy Sector. This Includes Liquid Transportation Fuel Derived From Lignocellulosic Plant Materials. However, One Of The Current Limiting Factors Restricting The Effective And Efficient Conversion Of Lignocellulosic Residues Is The Recalcitrance Of The Substrate To Enzymatic Conversion. • In An Attempt To Assess The Impact Of Cell Wall Lignin On Recalcitrance, We Subjected Poplar Trees Engineered With Altered Lignin Content And Composition To Two Potential Industrial Pretreatment Regimes, And Evaluated The Overall Efficacy Of The Bioconversion To Ethanol Process. • It Was Apparent That Total Lignin Content Has A Greater Impact Than Monomer Ratio (Syringyl : Guaiacyl) On Both Pretreatments. More Importantly, Low Lignin Plants Showed As Much As A 15% Improvement In The Efficiency Of Conversion, With Near Complete Hydrolysis Of The Cellulosic Polymer. • Using Genomic Tools To Breed Or Select For Modifications In Key Cell Wall Chemical And/Or Ultrastructural Traits Can Have A Profound Effect On Bioenergy Processing. These Techniques May Therefore Offer Means To Overcome The Current Obstacles That Underpin The Recalcitrance Of Lignocellulosic Substrates To Bioconversion.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Preparation and evaluation of lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates for growth by ethanologenic yeasts. Lignocellulosic Biomass Is A Potential Feedstock For Bioethanol Production. Biomass Hydrolysates, Prepared With A Procedure Including Pretreatment And Hydrolysis, Are Considered To Be Used As Fermentation Media For Microorganisms, Such As Yeast. During The Hydrolysate Preparation Procedure, Toxic Compounds Are Released Or Formed Which May Inhibit The Growth Of The Microorganism And Thus The Product Formation. To Study The Effects Of These Compounds On Fermentation Performance, The Production Of Various Hydrolysates With Diverse Inhibitory Effects Is Of Importance. A Platform Of Methods That Generates Hydrolysates Through Four Different Ways And Tests Their Inhibitory Effects Using Bioscreen C Analyzer Growth Tests Is Described Here. The Four Methods, Based On Concentrated Acid, Dilute Acid, Mild Alkaline And Alkaline/Oxidative Conditions, Were Used To Prepare Hydrolysates From Six Different Biomass Sources. The Resulting 24 Hydrolysates Showed Great Diversity On Growth Rate In Bioscreen C Analyzer Growth Tests. The Approach Allows The Prediction Of A Specific Hydrolysate'S Performance And Helps To Select Biomass Type And Hydrolysate Preparation Method For A Specific Production Strain, Or Vice Versa.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Scale-up and integration of alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ethanolic fermentation. Alkaline Hydrogen Peroxide (Ahp) Has Several Attractive Features As A Pretreatment In The Lignocellulosic Biomass-To-Ethanol Pipeline. Here, The Feasibility Of Scaling-Up The Ahp Process And Integrating It With Enzymatic Hydrolysis And Fermentation Was Studied. Corn Stover (1 Kg) Was Subjected To Ahp Pretreatment, Hydrolyzed Enzymatically, And The Resulting Sugars Fermented To Ethanol. The Ahp Pretreatment Was Performed At 0.125 G H(2) O(2) /G Biomass, 22°C, And Atmospheric Pressure For 48 H With Periodic Ph Readjustment. The Enzymatic Hydrolysis Was Performed In The Same Reactor Following Ph Neutralization Of The Biomass Slurry And Without Washing. After 48 H, Glucose And Xylose Yields Were 75% And 71% Of The Theoretical Maximum. Sterility Was Maintained During Pretreatment And Enzymatic Hydrolysis Without The Use Of Antibiotics. During Fermentation Using A Glucose- And Xylose-Utilizing Strain Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, All Of The Glc And 67% Of The Xyl Were Consumed In 120 H. The Final Ethanol Titer Was 13.7 G/L. Treatment Of The Enzymatic Hydrolysate With Activated Carbon Prior To Fermentation Had Little Effect On Glc Fermentation But Markedly Improved Utilization Of Xyl, Presumably Due To The Removal Of Soluble Aromatic Inhibitors. The Results Indicate That Ahp Is Readily Scalable And Can Be Integrated With Enzyme Hydrolysis And Fermentation. Compared To Other Leading Pretreatments For Lignocellulosic Biomass, Ahp Has Potential Advantages With Regard To Capital Costs, Process Simplicity, Feedstock Handling, And Compatibility With Enzymatic Deconstruction And Fermentation.

cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Development of yeast cell factories for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose to bioethanol through cell surface engineering. To Build An Energy And Material Secure Future, A Next Generation Of Renewable Fuels Produced From Lignocellulosic Biomass Is Required. Although Lignocellulosic Biomass, Which Represents An Abundant, Inexpensive And Renewable Source For Bioethanol Production, Is Of Great Interest As A Feedstock, The Complicated Ethanol Production Processes Involved Make The Cost Of Producing Bioethanol From It Higher Compared To Corn Starch And Cane Juice. Therefore, Consolidated Bioprocessing (Cbp), Which Combines Enzyme Production, Saccharification And Fermentation In A Single Step, Has Gained Increased Recognition As A Potential Bioethanol Production System.

The Development Of Recombinant Yeast Strains Displaying Cellulases And Hemicellulases On The Cell Surface Represents Significant Progress Toward Realization Of Cbp. Regardless Of The Process Used For Biomass Hydrolysis, Cbp-Enabling Microorganisms Encounter A Variety Of Toxic Compounds Produced During Biomass Pretreatment That Inhibit Microbial Growth And Ethanol Yield. Systems Biology Approaches Including Disruptome Screening, Transcriptomics, And Metabolomics Have Been Recently Exploited To Gain Insight Into The Molecular And Genetic Traits Involved In Tolerance And Adaptation To The Fermentation Inhibitors.

R7, Was Shown To Produce A Thermostable Cellulase With A High Hydrolytic Potential When Grown On Extrusion-Pretreated Agricultural Residues Such Corn Stover And Prairie Cord Grass. At 70°C And 15-20% Solids, The Thermostable Cellulase Was Able To Partially Liquefy Solid Biomass Only After 36 H Of Hydrolysis Time. The Hydrolytic Capabilities Of Geobacillus Sp. R7 Cellulase Were Comparable To Those Of A Commercial Cellulase. Fermentation Of The Enzymatic Hydrolyzates With Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Atcc 24860 Produced Ethanol Yields Of 0.45-0.50 G Ethanol/G Glucose With More Than 99% Glucose Utilization. It Was Further Demonstrated That Geobacillus Sp. R7 Can Ferment The Lignocellulosic Substrates To Ethanol In A Single Step That Could Facilitate The Development Of A Consolidated Bioprocessing As An Alternative Approach For Bioethanol Production With Outstanding Potential For Cost Reductions.

Recent Results Show That Treatments With Reducing Agents, Including The Sulfur Oxyanions Dithionite And Hydrogen Sulfite, Efficiently Improve The Fermentability Of Inhibitory Lignocellulose Hydrolysates, And That The Treatments Are Effective When The Reducing Agents Are Added In Situ Into The Fermentation Vessel At Low Temperature. In The Present Investigation, Dithionite Was Added To Medium With Model Inhibitors (Coniferyl Aldehyde, Furfural, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, Or Acetic Acid) And The Effects On The Fermentability With Yeast Were Studied. Addition Of 10 Mm Dithionite To Medium Containing 2.5 Mm Coniferyl Aldehyde Resulted In A Nine-Fold Increase In The Glucose Consumption Rate And A Three-Fold Increase In The Ethanol Yield. To Investigate The Mechanism Behind The Positive Effects Of Adding Sulfur Oxyanions, Mixtures Containing 2.5 Mm Of A Model Inhibitor (An Aromatic Compound, A Furan Aldehyde, Or An Aliphatic Acid) And 15 Mm Dithionite Or Hydrogen Sulfite Were Analyzed Using Mass Spectrometry (Ms). The Results Of The Analyses, Which Were Performed By Using Uhplc-Esi-Tof-Ms And Uhplc-Ltq/Orbitrap-Ms/Ms, Indicate That The Positive Effects Of Sulfur Oxyanions Are Primarily Due To Their Capability To React With And Sulfonate Inhibitory Aromatic Compounds And Furan Aldehydes At Low Temperature And Slightly Acidic Ph (Such As 25°C And Ph 5.5).

This Was Most Likely Due To The Presence Of Inhibitors Such As Acetate Or Furfural. In 1:5 Hydrolysate, S. Cerevisiae Grew, But Not D. Bruxellensis, And In 1:10 Hydrolysate, Both Yeasts Grew. An External Vitamin Source (E.G. Yeast Extract) Was Essential For Growth Of D. Bruxellensis In This Lignocellulosic Hydrolysate And Strongly Stimulated S. Cerevisiae Growth And Ethanol Production. Ethanol Yields Of 0.42 ± 0.01 G Ethanol (G Glucose)⁻¹ Were Observed For Both Yeasts In 1:10 Hydrolysate. In Small-Scale Continuous Cultures With Cell Recirculation, With A Gradual Increase In The Hydrolysate Concentration, D. Bruxellensis Was Able To Grow In 1:5 Hydrolysate. In Bioreactor Experiments With Cell Recirculation, Hydrolysate Contents Were Increased Up To 1:2 Hydrolysate, Without Significant Losses In Ethanol Yields For Both Yeasts And Only Slight Differences In Viable Cell Counts, Indicating An Ability Of Both Yeasts To Adapt To Toxic Compounds In The Hydrolysate.Dekkera Bruxellensis And S. Cerevisiae Have A Similar Potential To Ferment Lignocellulose Hydrolysate To Ethanol And To Adapt To Fermentation Inhibitors In The Hydrolysate.This Is The First Study Investigating The Potential Of D. Bruxellensis To Ferment Lignocellulosic Hydrolysate. Its High Competitiveness In Industrial Fermentations Makes D. Bruxellensis An Interesting Alternative For Ethanol Production From Those Substrates.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Cupriavidus necator JMP134 rapidly reduces furfural with a Zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. Ethanol Is A Renewable Biofuel, And It Can Be Produced From Lignocellulosic Biomass. The Biomass Is Usually Converted To Hydrolysates That Consist Of Sugar And Sugar Derivatives, Such As Furfural. Yeast Ferments Sugar To Ethanol, But Furfural Higher Than 3 Mm Is Inhibitory. It Can Take Several Days For Yeast Cells To Reduce Furfural To Non-Inhibitory Furfuryl Alcohol Before Producing Ethanol. Bioreduction Of Furfural To Furfuryl Alcohol Before Fermentation May Relieve Yeast From Furfural Toxicity. We Observed That Cupriavidus Necator Jmp134, A Strict Aerobe, Rapidly Reduced 17 Mm Furfural To Less Than 3 Mm Within 14 Min With Cell Turbidity Of 1.0 At 600 Nm At 50°C. The Rapid Reduction Consumed Ethanol. The "Furfural Reductase" (Furx) Was Purified, And It Oxidized Ethanol To Acetaldehyde And Reduced Furfural To Furfuryl Alcohol With Nad(+) As The Cofactor. The Protein Was Identified With Mass Spectrometry Fingerprinting To Be A Hypothetical Protein Belonging To Zn-Dependent Alcohol Dehydrogenase Family. The Furx-Inactivation Mutant Of C. Necator Jmp134 Lost The Ability To Rapidly Reduce Furfural, And Escherichia Coli Producing Recombinant Furx Gained The Ability. Thus, An Alcohol Dehydrogenase Enabled Bacteria To Rapidly Reduce Furfural With Ethanol As The Reducing Power.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Detoxification of a lignocellulosic biomass slurry by soluble polyelectrolyte adsorption for improved fermentation efficiency. This Study Investigated The Detoxification Of A Dilute Acid Pretreated Ponderosa Pine Slurry Using The Polyelectrolyte Polyethyleneimine (Pei). The Addition Of Polyelectrolyte To Remove Enzymatic And/Or Fermentation Inhibitory Compounds, That Is, Acetic Acid, Furfural, And 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (Hmf), Was Performed Either Before Or After Enzymatic Hydrolysis To Determine The Optimal Process Sequence. Negligible Acetic Acid, Glucose, And Xylose Were Removed Regardless Of Where In The Process The Polymer Addition Was Made. Maximum Furfural And Hmf Separation Was Achieved With The Addition Of Pei To A Clarified Pre-Enzymatic Hydrolysis Liquor, Which Showed That 88.3% Of Furfural And 66.4% Of Hmf Could Be Removed. On The Other Hand, Only 23.1% And 13.4% Of Furfural And Hmf, Respectively, Were Removed From A Post-Enzymatic Hydrolysis Sample; Thus, The Effects Of Enzymes, Glucose, And Wood Solids On Inhibitor Removal Were Also Investigated. The Presence Of Solid Particles >0.2 Μm And Unknown Soluble Components <10 Kda Reduced Inhibitory Compound Removal, But The Presence Of Elevated Glucose Levels And Enzymes (Cellulases) Did Not Affect The Separation. The Fermentability Of Detoxified Versus Undetoxified Hydrolysate Was Also Investigated. An Ethanol Yield Of 92.6% Of Theoretical Was Achieved With Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Fermenting The Detoxified Hydrolyzate, While No Significant Ethanol Was Produced In The Undetoxified Hydrolyzate. These Results Indicate That Pei May Provide A Practical Alternative For Furan Removal And Detoxification Of Lignocellolosic Hydrolysates, And That Application Before Enzymatic Hydrolysis Minimizes Separation Interferences.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Microbial renewable feedstock utilization: a substrate-oriented approach. Increasingly Lignocellulosic Biomass Hydrolysates Are Used As The Feedstock For Industrial Fermentations. These Biomass Hydrolysates Consist Of Complex Mixtures Of Different Fermentable Sugars, But Also Contain Inhibitors And Salts That Affect The Performance Of The Product-Generating Microbes. The Performance Of Six Industrially Relevant Microorganisms, I.E., Two Bacteria (Escherichia Coli And Corynebacterium Glutamicum), Two Yeasts (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Pichia Stipitis) And Two Fungi (Aspergillus Niger And Trichoderma Reesei) Were Compared For Their Ability To Utilize And Grow On Different Feedstock Hydrolysates (Corn Stover, Wheat Straw, Sugar Cane Bagasse And Willow Wood). Moreover, The Ability Of The Selected Hosts To Utilize Waste Glycerol From The Biodiesel Industry Was Evaluated. P. Stipitis And A. Niger Were Found To Be The Most Versatile And C. Glutamicum, And S. Cerevisiae Were Shown To Be The Least Adapted To Renewable Feedstocks. Clear Differences In The Utilization Of The More Abundant Carbon Sources In These Feedstocks Were Observed Between The Different Species. Moreover, In A Species-Specific Way The Production Of Various Metabolites, In Particular Polyols, Alcohols And Organic Acids Was Observed During Fermentation. Based On The Results Obtained We Conclude That A Substrate-Oriented Instead Of The More Commonly Used Product Oriented Approach Towards The Selection Of A Microbial Production Host Will Avoid The Requirement For Extensive Metabolic Engineering. Instead Of Introducing Multiple Substrate Utilization And Detoxification Routes To Efficiently Utilize Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates Only One Biosynthesis Route Forming The Product Of Interest Has To Be Engineered.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae capable of simultaneous cellobiose and xylose fermentation. The Use Of Plant Biomass For Biofuel Production Will Require Efficient Utilization Of The Sugars In Lignocellulose, Primarily Glucose And Xylose. However, Strains Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Presently Used In Bioethanol Production Ferment Glucose But Not Xylose. Yeasts Engineered To Ferment Xylose Do So Slowly, And Cannot Utilize Xylose Until Glucose Is Completely Consumed. To Overcome These Bottlenecks, We Engineered Yeasts To Coferment Mixtures Of Xylose And Cellobiose. In These Yeast Strains, Hydrolysis Of Cellobiose Takes Place Inside Yeast Cells Through The Action Of An Intracellular Β-Glucosidase Following Import By A High-Affinity Cellodextrin Transporter. Intracellular Hydrolysis Of Cellobiose Minimizes Glucose Repression Of Xylose Fermentation Allowing Coconsumption Of Cellobiose And Xylose. The Resulting Yeast Strains, Cofermented Cellobiose And Xylose Simultaneously And Exhibited Improved Ethanol Yield When Compared To Fermentation With Either Cellobiose Or Xylose As Sole Carbon Sources. We Also Observed Improved Yields And Productivities From Cofermentation Experiments Performed With Simulated Cellulosic Hydrolyzates, Suggesting This Is A Promising Cofermentation Strategy For Cellulosic Biofuel Production. The Successful Integration Of Cellobiose And Xylose Fermentation Pathways In Yeast Is A Critical Step Towards Enabling Economic Biofuel Production.

The Dependency On Depleting Natural Resources Is A Challenge For Energy Security That Can Be Potentially Answered By Bioenergy. Bioenergy Is Derived From Starchy And Lignocellulosic Biomass In The Form Of Bioethanol Or From Vegetable Oils In The Form Of Biodiesel Fuel. The Acid And Enzymatic Methods Have Been Developed For The Hydrolysis Of Biomass And For Transesterifiaction Of Plant Oils. However, Acid Hydrolysis Results In The Production Of Unnatural Compounds Which Has Adverse Effects On Yeast Fermentation. Recent Advancements In The Yeast Cell Surface Engineering Developed Strategies To Genetically Immobilize Amylolytic, Cellulolytic And Xylanolytic Enzymes On Yeast Cell Surface For The Production Of Fuel Ethanol From Biomass. This Review Gives An Insight In To The Recent Technological Developments In The Production Of Bioenergy, I.E, Bioethanol Using Surface Engineered Yeast.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	[Application of systems biology and synthetic biology in strain improvement for biofuel production].

Due To Its Potential For Significant Cost Reduction, Cbp Is Receiving More And More Attention. In This Review Article, We Discuss The Factors That Influence The Expression Level Of Cellulases In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae And Updated Progress In Bioethanol Production From Lignocellulose By The Cbp Strategy Using The Yeast Species.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Simultaneous consumption of pentose and hexose sugars: an optimal microbial phenotype for efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. Lignocellulosic Biomass Is An Attractive Carbon Source For Bio-Based Fuel And Chemical Production; However, Its Compositional Heterogeneity Hinders Its Commercial Use. Since Most Microbes Possess Carbon Catabolite Repression (Ccr), Mixed Sugars Derived From The Lignocellulose Are Consumed Sequentially, Reducing The Efficacy Of The Overall Process. To Overcome This Barrier, Microbes That Exhibit The Simultaneous Consumption Of Mixed Sugars Have Been Isolated And/Or Developed And Evaluated For The Lignocellulosic Biomass Utilization. Specific Strains Of Escherichia Coli, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, And Zymomonas Mobilis Have Been Engineered For Simultaneous Glucose And Xylose Utilization Via Mutagenesis Or Introduction Of A Xylose Metabolic Pathway. Other Microbes, Such As Lactobacillus Brevis, Lactobacillus Buchneri, And Candida Shehatae Possess A Relaxed Ccr Mechanism, Showing Simultaneous Consumption Of Glucose And Xylose. By Exploiting Ccr-Negative Phenotypes, Various Integrated Processes Have Been Developed That Incorporate Both Enzyme Hydrolysis Of Lignocellulosic Material And Mixed Sugar Fermentation, Thereby Enabling Greater Productivity And Fermentation Efficacy.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Biorefining of wood: combined production of ethanol and xylanase from waste fiber sludge. The Possibility To Utilize Fiber Sludge, Waste Fibers From Pulp Mills And Lignocellulose-Based Biorefineries, For Combined Production Of Liquid Biofuel And Biocatalysts Was Investigated. Without Pretreatment, Fiber Sludge Was Hydrolyzed Enzymatically To Monosaccharides, Mainly Glucose And Xylose. In The First Of Two Sequential Fermentation Steps, The Fiber Sludge Hydrolysate Was Fermented To Cellulosic Ethanol With The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Although The Final Ethanol Yields Were Similar, The Ethanol Productivity After 9.5 H Was 3.3 G/L/H For The Fiber Sludge Hydrolysate Compared With Only 2.2 G/L/H For A Reference Fermentation With Similar Sugar Content. In The Second Fermentation Step, The Spent Fiber Sludge Hydrolysate (The Stillage Obtained After Distillation) Was Used As Growth Medium For Recombinant Aspergillus Niger Expressing The Xylanase-Encoding Trichoderma Reesei (Hypocrea Jecorina) Xyn2 Gene. The Xylanase Activity Obtained With The Spent Fiber Sludge Hydrolysate (8,500 Nkat/Ml) Was Higher Than That Obtained In A Standard Medium With Similar Monosaccharide Content (1,400 Nkat/Ml). Analyses Based On Deglycosylation With N-Glycosidase F Suggest That The Main Part Of The Recombinant Xylanase Was Unglycosylated And Had Molecular Mass Of 20.7 Kda, While A Minor Part Had N-Linked Glycosylation And Molecular Mass Of 23.6 Kda. Chemical Analyses Of The Growth Medium Showed That Important Carbon Sources In The Spent Fiber Sludge Hydrolysate Included Xylose, Small Aliphatic Acids, And Oligosaccharides. The Results Show The Potential Of Converting Waste Fiber Sludge To Liquid Biofuel And Enzymes As Coproducts In Lignocellulose-Based Biorefineries.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	An analysis of feasibility of bioethanol production from Taiwan sorghum liquor waste. In Order To Evaluate The Feasibility Of Using Sorghum Liquor Waste For Bioethanol Production, We Serially Investigated The Effectiveness Of Physical Treatment, Microwave Irradiation Pretreatment, Enzymatic Hydrolysis, And Fermentation. Composition Analysis Revealed That Kinmen Sorghum Liquor Waste (Ks) And Chiayi Sorghum Liquor Waste (Cs) Contain Approximately 17.2+/-0.7% And 18.2+/-0.6% Cellulose, 19.0+/-0.6% And 21.6+/-1.0% Hemicellulose, 18.5+/-0.8% And 20.6+/-1.7% Acid Detergent Lignin, And 22.1+/-0.7% And 23.3+/-0.4% Starch, Respectively, On Dry Weight Basis. The Reducing Sugar Yield Obtained After Microwave Irradiation Pretreatment And Enzymatic Hydrolysis Of Ks And Cs Were 331.1 And 341.3Mg/G Dry Weight. The Ethanol Yields Obtained After Fermentation Of Ks And Cs Hydrolysates With Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Were 0.13 And 0.14 G/G Dry Weight, Respectively. This Operation Of Pretreatment May Provide A Suggestible Pattern Of Utilizing Feedstock That Contain Lignocellulose And Starchy For Ethanolic Fermentation.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Ethanol production from SPORL-pretreated lodgepole pine: preliminary evaluation of mass balance and process energy efficiency. Lodgepole Pine From Forest Thinnings Is A Potential Feedstock For Ethanol Production. In This Study, Lodgepole Pine Was Converted To Ethanol With A Yield Of 276 L Per Metric Ton Of Wood Or 72% Of Theoretical Yield. The Lodgepole Pine Chips Were Directly Subjected To Sulfite Pretreatment To Overcome Recalcitrance Of Lignocellulose (Sporl) Pretreatment And Then Disk-Milled; The Recovered Cellulose Substrate Was Quais-Simultaneously Saccharified Enzymatically And Fermented To Ethanol Using Commercial Cellulases And Saccharomyces Cerevisiae D5A. The Liquor Stream From The Pretreatment Containing Hydrolyzed Sugars Mainly From Hemicelluloses Was Fermented By The Same Yeast Strain After Detoxification Using An Xad Resin Column. The Sporl Pretreatment Was Conducted At 180 Degrees C For A Period Of 25 Min With A Liquor-To-Wood Ratio Of 3:1 (V/W) In A Laboratory Digester. Three Levels Of Sulfuric Acid Charge (0.0%, 1.4%, And 2.2% On An Oven Dried Wood Basis In W/W) And Three Levels Of Sodium Bisulfite Charge (0.0%, 4.0%, And 8.0% In W/W) Were Applied. Mechanical And Thermal Energy Consumption For Milling And Pretreatment Were Determined. These Data Were Used To Determine The Efficiency Of Sugar Recoveries And Net Ethanol Energy Production Values And To Formulate A Preliminary Mass And Energy Balance.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	Properties of ethanol fermentation by Flammulina velutipes. Basidiomycetes Have The Ability To Degrade Lignocellulosic Biomass, And Some Basidiomycetes Produce Alcohol Dehydrogenase. These Characteristics May Be Useful In The Direct Production Of Ethanol From Lignocellulose. Ethanol Fermentation By Basidiomycetes Was Investigated To Examine The Possibility Of Ethanol Production By Consolidated Bioprocessing (Cbp) Using Flammulina Velutipes. F. Velutipes Converted D-Glucose To Ethanol With A High Efficiency (A Theoretical Ethanol Recovery Rate Of 88%), But Ethanol Production From Pentose Was Not Observed. These Properties Of F. Velutipes Are Similar To Those Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, But The Basidiomycete Converted Not Only Sucrose, But Also Maltose, Cellobiose, Cellotriose, And Cellotetraose To Ethanol, With Almost The Same Efficiency As That For D-Glucose. From These Results, We Concluded That F. Velutipes Possesses Advantageous Characteristics For Use In Cbp.
cerevisiae biofuel lignocellulose	[Metabolic engineering of the initial stages of xylose catabolism in yeasts for construction of efficient producers of ethanol from lignocelluloses]. Plant Biomass Possesses A Huge Potential As A Source For Biofuel Production. The Main Components Of Biomass Are Glucose And Five-Carbon Sugar Xylose. The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae That Is Used For Industrial Ethanol Production From Glucose Is Unable To Xylose Fermentation. Therefore A Microorganism Capable For Efficient Fermentation Of Both Glucose And Xylose Has To Be Found In Nature Or Constructed For Economically Feasible Biomass Conversion To Ethanol. The Active Xylose Fermentation Could Be Performed By Increasing The Efficiency Of Initial Stages Of Xylose Metabolism. In This Review The Enzymes Of Initial Stages Of Xylose Metabolism In Yeasts (Xylose Reductase, Xylitol Dehydrogenase, Xylulokinase) And Bacteria (Xylose Isomerase And Xylulokinase) Are Characterized. The Ways For Construction Of Yeast Strains Capable Of Efficient Alcoholic Xylose Fermentation Are Discussed.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Mitochondria-organelle contact sites: the plot thickens. Membrane Contact Sites (Mcss) Are Areas Of Close Apposition Between The Membranes Of Two Different Organelles That Enable Non-Vesicular Transfer Of Ions And Lipids. Recent Studies Reveal That Mitochondria Maintain Contact Sites With Organelles Other Than The Endoplasmic Reticulum Such As The Vacuole, Plasma Membrane And Peroxisomes. This Review Focuses On Novel Findings Achieved Mainly In Yeast Regarding Tethers, Function And Regulation Of Mitochondria-Organelle Contact Sites. The Emerging Network Of Mcss Linking Virtually All Cellular Organelles Is Highly Dynamic And Integrated With Cellular Metabolism.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	No peroxisome is an island - Peroxisome contact sites. In Order To Optimize Their Multiple Cellular Functions, Peroxisomes Must Collaborate And Communicate With The Surrounding Organelles. A Common Way Of Communication Between Organelles Is Through Physical Membrane Contact Sites Where Membranes Of Two Organelles Are Tethered, Facilitating Exchange Of Small Molecules And Intracellular Signaling. In Addition Contact Sites Are Important For Controlling Processes Such As Metabolism, Organelle Trafficking, Inheritance And Division. How Peroxisomes Rely On Contact Sites For Their Various Cellular Activities Is Only Recently Starting To Be Appreciated And Explored And The Extent Of Peroxisomal Communication, Their Contact Sites And Their Functions Are Less Characterized. In This Review We Summarize The Identified Peroxisomal Contact Sites, Their Tethering Complexes And Their Potential Physiological Roles. Additionally, We Highlight Some Of The Preliminary Evidence That Exists In The Field For Unexplored Peroxisomal Contact Sites.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	The birth of yeast peroxisomes. This Contribution Describes The Phenotypic Differences Of Yeast Peroxisome-Deficient Mutants (Pex Mutants). In Some Cases Different Phenotypes Were Reported For Yeast Mutants Deleted In The Same Pex Gene. These Differences Are Most Likely Related To The Marker Proteins And Methods Used To Detect Peroxisomal Remnants. This Is Especially Evident For Pex3 And Pex19 Mutants, Where The Localization Of Receptor Docking Proteins (Pex13, Pex14) Resulted In The Identification Of Peroxisomal Membrane Remnants, Which Do Not Contain Other Peroxisomal Membrane Proteins, Such As The Ring Proteins Pex2, Pex10 And Pex12. These Structures In Pex3 And Pex19 Cells Are The Template For Peroxisome Formation Upon Introduction Of The Missing Gene. Taken Together, These Data Suggest That In All Yeast Pex Mutants Analyzed So Far Peroxisomes Are Not Formed De Novo But Use Membrane Remnant Structures As A Template For Peroxisome Formation Upon Reintroduction Of The Missing Gene. The Relevance Of This Model For Peroxisomal Membrane Protein And Lipid Sorting To Peroxisomes Is Discussed.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Structural insights into cargo recognition by the yeast PTS1 receptor. The Peroxisomal Matrix Protein Import Is Facilitated By Cycling Import Receptors That Shuttle Between The Cytosol And The Peroxisomal Membrane. The Import Receptor Pex5P Mediates The Import Of Proteins Harboring A Peroxisomal Targeting Signal Of Type I (Pts1). Purified Recombinant Pex5P Forms A Dimeric Complex With The Pts1-Protein Pcs60P In Vitro With A Kd Of 0.19 Μm. To Analyze The Structural Basis For Receptor-Cargo Recognition, The Pts1 And Adjacent Amino Acids Of Pcs60P Were Systematically Scanned For Pex5P Binding By An In Vitro Site-Directed Photo-Cross-Linking Approach. The Cross-Linked Binding Regions Of The Receptor Were Subsequently Identified By High Resolution Mass Spectrometry. Most Cross-Links Were Found With Tpr6, Tpr7, As Well As The 7C-Loop Of Pex5P. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis Revealed A Bivalent Interaction Mode For Pex5P And Pcs60P. Interestingly, Pcs60P Lacking Its C-Terminal Tripeptide Sequence Was Efficiently Cross-Linked To The Same Regions Of Pex5P. The Kd Value Of The Interaction Of Truncated Pcs60P And Pex5P Was In The Range Of 7.7 Μm. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry And Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements Revealed A Monovalent Binding Mode For The Interaction Of Pex5P And Pcs60P Lacking The Pts1. Our Data Indicate That Pcs60P Contains A Second Contact Site For Its Receptor Pex5P, Beyond The C-Terminal Tripeptide. The Physiological Relevance Of The Ancillary Binding Region Was Supported By In Vivo Import Studies. The Bivalent Binding Mode Might Be Explained By A Two-Step Concept As Follows: First, Cargo Recognition And Initial Tethering By The Pts1-Receptor Pex5P; Second, Lock-In Of Receptor And Cargo.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Genome-Wide Localization Study of Yeast Pex11 Identifies Peroxisome-Mitochondria Interactions through the ERMES Complex. Pex11 Is A Peroxin That Regulates The Number Of Peroxisomes In Eukaryotic Cells. Recently, It Was Found That A Mutation In One Of The Three Mammalian Paralogs, Pex11Β, Results In A Neurological Disorder. The Molecular Function Of Pex11, However, Is Not Known. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Pex11 Has Been Shown To Recruit To Peroxisomes The Mitochondrial Fission Machinery, Thus Enabling Proliferation Of Peroxisomes. This Process Is Essential For Efficient Fatty Acid Β-Oxidation. In This Study, We Used High-Content Microscopy On A Genome-Wide Scale To Determine The Subcellular Localization Pattern Of Yeast Pex11 In All Non-Essential Gene Deletion Mutants, As Well As In Temperature-Sensitive Essential Gene Mutants. Pex11 Localization And Morphology Of Peroxisomes Was Profoundly Affected By Mutations In 104 Different Genes That Were Functionally Classified. A Group Of Genes Encompassing Mdm10, Mdm12 And Mdm34 That Encode The Mitochondrial And Cytosolic Components Of The Ermes Complex Was Analyzed In Greater Detail. Deletion Of These Genes Caused A Specifically Altered Pex11 Localization Pattern, Whereas Deletion Of Mmm1, The Gene Encoding The Fourth, Endoplasmic-Reticulum-Associated Component Of The Complex, Did Not Result In An Altered Pex11 Localization Or Peroxisome Morphology Phenotype. Moreover, We Found That Pex11 And Mdm34 Physically Interact And That Pex11 Plays A Role In Establishing The Contact Sites Between Peroxisomes And Mitochondria Through The Ermes Complex. Based On These Results, We Propose That The Mitochondrial/Cytosolic Components Of The Ermes Complex Establish A Direct Interaction Between Mitochondria And Peroxisomes Through Pex11.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Making connections: interorganelle contacts orchestrate mitochondrial behavior. Mitochondria Are Highly Dynamic Organelles. During Their Life Cycle They Frequently Fuse And Divide, And Damaged Mitochondria Are Removed By Autophagic Degradation. These Processes Serve To Maintain Mitochondrial Function And Ensure Optimal Energy Supply For The Cell. It Has Recently Become Clear That This Complex Mitochondrial Behavior Is Governed To A Large Extent By Interactions With Other Organelles. In This Review, We Describe Mitochondrial Contacts With The Endoplasmic Reticulum (Er), Plasma Membrane, And Peroxisomes. In Particular, We Highlight How Mitochondrial Fission, Distribution, Inheritance, And Turnover Are Orchestrated By Interorganellar Contacts In Yeast And Metazoa. These Interactions Are Pivotal For The Integration Of The Dynamic Mitochondrial Network Into The Architecture Of Eukaryotic Cells.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	The peroxisomal receptor dislocation pathway: to the exportomer and beyond. The Biogenesis Of Peroxisomes Is An Ubiquitin-Dependent Process. In Particular, The Import Of Matrix Proteins Into The Peroxisomal Lumen Requires The Modification Of Import Receptors With Ubiquitin. The Matrix Proteins Are Synthesized On Free Polyribosomes In The Cytosol And Are Recognized By Import Receptors Via A Peroxisomal Targeting Sequence (Pts). Subsequent To The Transport Of The Receptor/Cargo-Complex To The Peroxisomal Membrane And The Release Of The Cargo Into The Peroxisomal Lumen, The Pts-Receptors Are Exported Back To The Cytosol For Further Rounds Of Matrix Protein Import. The Exportomer Represents The Molecular Machinery Required For The Retrotranslocation Of The Pts-Receptors. It Comprises Enzymes For The Ubiquitination As Well As For The Atp-Dependent Extraction Of The Pts-Receptors From The Peroxisomal Membrane. Furthermore, Recent Evidence Indicates A Mechanistic Interconnection Of The Atp-Dependent Removal Of The Pts-Receptors With The Translocation Of The Matrix Protein Into The Organellar Lumen. Interestingly, The Components Of The Peroxisomal Exportomer Seem Also To Be Involved In Cellular Tasks That Are Distinct From The Ubiquitination And Dislocation Of The Peroxisomal Pts-Receptors. This Includes Work That Indicates A Central Function Of This Machinery In The Export Of Peroxisomal Matrix Proteins In Plants, While A Subset Of Exportomer Components Is Involved In The Meiocyte Formation In Some Fungi, The Peroxisome-Chloroplast Contact During Photorespiration In Plants And Possibly Even The Selective Degradation Of Peroxisomes Via Pexophagy. In This Review, We Want To Discuss The Central Role Of The Exportomer During Matrix Protein Import, But Also Highlight Distinct Roles Of Exportomer Constituents In Additional Cellular Processes. This Article Is Part Of A Special Issue Entitled: Peroxisomes: Biogenesis, Functions And Diseases.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Mitochondrial lipid transport at a glance. Lipids Are The Building Blocks Of Cellular Membranes And Are Synthesized At Distinct Parts Of The Cell. A Precise Control Of Lipid Synthesis And Distribution Is Crucial For Cell Function And Survival. The Endoplasmic Reticulum (Er) Is The Major Lipid-Synthesizing Organelle. However, A Subset Of Lipids Is Synthesized Within Mitochondria, And This Aspect Has Become A Focus Of Recent Lipid Research. Mitochondria Form A Dynamic Membrane Network That Is Reshaped By Fusion And Fission Events. Their Functionality Therefore Depends On A Continuous Lipid Supply From The Er And The Distribution Of Lipids Between Both Mitochondrial Membranes. The Mechanisms Of Mitochondrial Lipid Trafficking Are Only Now Emerging And Appear To Involve Membrane Contact Sites And Lipid Transfer Proteins. In This Cell Science At A Glance Article, We Will Discuss Recent Discoveries In The Field Of Mitochondrial Lipid Trafficking That Build On Long-Standing Observations And Shed New Light On The Shuttling Of Membrane Lipids Between Mitochondria And Other Organelles.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	A combined approach of quantitative interaction proteomics and live-cell imaging reveals a regulatory role for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reticulon homology proteins in peroxisome biogenesis. Peroxisome Biogenesis Initiates At The Endoplasmic Reticulum (Er) And Maturation Allows For The Formation Of Metabolically Active Organelles. Yet, Peroxisomes Can Also Multiply By Growth And Division. Several Proteins, Called Peroxins, Are Known To Participate In These Processes But Little Is Known About Their Organization To Orchestrate Peroxisome Proliferation. Here, We Demonstrate That Regulation Of Peroxisome Proliferation Relies On The Integrity Of The Tubular Er Network. Using A Dual Track Silac-Based Quantitative Interaction Proteomics Approach, We Established A Comprehensive Network Of Stable As Well As Transient Interactions Of The Peroxin Pex30P, An Integral Membrane Protein. Through Association With Merely Er Resident Proteins, In Particular With Proteins Containing A Reticulon Homology Domain, And With Other Peroxins, Pex30P Designates Peroxisome Contact Sites At Er Subdomains. We Show That Pex30P Traffics Through The Er And Segregates In Punctae To Which Peroxisomes Specifically Append, And We Ascertain Its Transient Interaction With All Subunits Of The Copi Coatomer Complex Suggesting The Involvement Of A Vesicle-Mediated Transport. We Establish That The Membrane Protein Pex30P Facilitates The Connection Of Peroxisomes To The Er. Taken Together, Our Data Indicate That Pex30P-Containing Protein Complexes Act As Focal Points From Which Peroxisomes Can Form And That The Tubular Er Architecture Organized By The Reticulon Homology Proteins Rtn1P, Rtn2P And Yop1P Controls This Process.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Interactomic study on interaction between lipid droplets and mitochondria. An Increasing Body Of Evidence Shows That The Lipid Droplet, A Neutral Lipid Storage Organelle, Plays A Role In Lipid Metabolism And Energy Homeostasis Through Its Interaction With Mitochondria. However, The Cellular Functions And Molecular Mechanisms Of The Interaction Remain Ambiguous. Here We Present Data From Transmission Electron Microscopy, Fluorescence Imaging, And Reconstitution Assays, Demonstrating That Lipid Droplets Physically Contact Mitochondria In Vivo And In Vitro. Using A Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation Assay In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae, We Generated An Interactomic Map Of Protein-Protein Contacts Of Lipid Droplets With Mitochondria And Peroxisomes. The Lipid Droplet Proteins Erg6 And Pet10 Were Found To Be Involved In 75% Of The Interactions Detected. Interestingly, Interactions Between 3 Pairs Of Lipid Metabolic Enzymes Were Detected. Collectively, These Data Demonstrate That Lipid Droplets Make Physical Contacts With Mitochondria And Peroxisomes, And Reveal Specific Molecular Interactions That Suggest Active Participation Of Lipid Droplets In Lipid Metabolism In Yeast.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	The unusual extended C-terminal helix of the peroxisomal α/β-hydrolase Lpx1 is involved in dimer contacts but dispensable for dimerization. The Yeast Peroxisomal Hydrolase Lpx1 Belongs To The Α/Β-Hydrolase Superfamily. In The Absence Of Lpx1, Yeast Peroxisomes Show An Aberrant Vacuolated Morphology Similar To What Is Found In Peroxisomal Disorder Patients. Here, We Present The Crystal Structure Of Lpx1 Determined At A Resolution Of 1.9 Å. The Structure Reveals The Complete Catalytic Triad With An Unusual Location Of The Acid Residue After Strand Β6 Of The Canonical Α/Β-Hydrolase Fold. A Four-Helix Cap Domain Covers The Active Site. The Interface Between The Α/Β-Hydrolase Core And The Cap Domain Forms The Potential Substrate Binding Site, Which May Also Comprise The Tunnel That Leads Into The Protein Interior And Widens Into A Cavity. Two Further Tunnels Connect The Active Site To The Protein Surface, Potentially Facilitating Substrate Access. Lpx1 Is A Homodimer. The Α/Β-Hydrolase Core Folds Of The Two Protomers Form The Dimer Contact Site. Further Dimerization Contacts Arise From The Mutual Embracement Of The Cap Domain Of One Protomer By The Non-Canonical C-Terminal Helix Of The Other, Resulting In A Total Buried Surface Area Of Some 6000 Å². The Unusual C-Terminal Helix Sticks Out From The Core Fold To Which It Is Connected By An Extended Flexible Loop. We Analyzed Whether This Helix Is Required For Dimerization And For Import Of The Dimer Into Peroxisomes Using Biochemical Assays In Vitro And A Microscopy-Based Interaction Assay In Mammalian Cells. Surprisingly, The C-Terminal Helix Is Dispensable For Dimerization And Dimer Import. The Unusually Robust Self-Interaction Suggests That Lpx1 Is Imported Into Peroxisomes As Dimer.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesized by three different pathways is supplied to peroxisomes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In The Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Three Pathways Lead To The Formation Of Phosphatidylethanolamine (Pe), Namely Decarboxylation Of Phosphatidylserine (Ps) (I) By Psd1P In Mitochondria, And (Ii) By Psd2P In A Golgi/Vacuolar Compartment; And (Iii) Synthesis Via Cdp-Ethanolamine Pathway In The Endoplasmic Reticulum. To Determine The Contribution Of These Pathways To The Supply Of Pe To Peroxisomes, We Subjected Mutants Bearing Defects In The Respective Metabolic Routes To Biochemical And Cell Biological Analysis. Despite These Defects In Pe Formation Mutants Were Able To Grow On Oleic Acid Indicating Induction Of Peroxisome Proliferation. Biochemical Analysis Revealed That Pe Formed Through All Three Pathways Was Supplied To Peroxisomes. These Analyses Also Demonstrated That Selective As Well As Equilibrium Interorganelle Flux Of Pe Appear To Be Equally Important For Cellular Homeostasis Of This Phospholipid. Electron Microscopic Inspection Confirmed That Defects In Pe Synthesis Still Allowed Formation Of Peroxisomes, Although These Organelles From Strains Lacking Psd1 Were Significantly Smaller Than Wild Type. The Fact That Peroxisomes Were Always Found In Close Vicinity To Mitochondria, Er And Lipid Particles Supported The View That Membrane Contact May Play A Role In Lipid Traffic Between These Organelles.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	An intimate collaboration between peroxisomes and lipid bodies. Although Peroxisomes Oxidize Lipids, The Metabolism Of Lipid Bodies And Peroxisomes Is Thought To Be Largely Uncoupled From One Another. In This Study, Using Oleic Acid-Cultured Saccharomyces Cerevisiae As A Model System, We Provide Evidence That Lipid Bodies And Peroxisomes Have A Close Physiological Relationship. Peroxisomes Adhere Stably To Lipid Bodies, And They Can Even Extend Processes Into Lipid Body Cores. Biochemical Experiments And Proteomic Analysis Of The Purified Lipid Bodies Suggest That These Processes Are Limited To Enzymes Of Fatty Acid Beta Oxidation. Peroxisomes That Are Unable To Oxidize Fatty Acids Promote Novel Structures Within Lipid Bodies ("Gnarls"), Which May Be Organized Arrays Of Accumulated Free Fatty Acids. However, Gnarls Are Suppressed, And Fatty Acids Are Not Accumulated In The Absence Of Peroxisomal Membranes. Our Results Suggest That The Extensive Physical Contact Between Peroxisomes And Lipid Bodies Promotes The Coupling Of Lipolysis Within Lipid Bodies With Peroxisomal Fatty Acid Oxidation.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Saccharomyces cerevisiae acyl-CoA oxidase follows a novel, non-PTS1, import pathway into peroxisomes that is dependent on Pex5p. The Peroxisomal Protein Acyl-Coa Oxidase (Pox1P) Of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Lacks Either Of The Two Well Characterized Peroxisomal Targeting Sequences Known As Pts1 And Pts2. Here We Demonstrate That Peroxisomal Import Of Pox1P Is Nevertheless Dependent On Binding To Pex5P, The Pts1 Import Receptor. The Interaction Between Pex5P And Pox1P, However, Involves Novel Contact Sites In Both Proteins. The Interaction Region In Pex5P Is Located In A Defined Area Of The Amino-Terminal Part Of The Protein Outside Of The Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain Involved In Pts1 Recognition; The Interaction Site In Pox1P Is Located Internally And Not At The Carboxyl Terminus Where A Pts1 Is Normally Found. By Making Use Of Pex5 Mutants That Are Either Specifically Disturbed In Binding Of Pts1 Proteins Or In Binding Of Pox1P, We Demonstrate The Existence Of Two Independent, Pex5P-Mediated Import Pathways Into Peroxisomes In Yeast As Follows: A Classical Pts1 Pathway And A Novel, Non-Pts1 Pathway For Pox1P.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Cvt9/Gsa9 functions in sequestering selective cytosolic cargo destined for the vacuole. Three Overlapping Pathways Mediate The Transport Of Cytoplasmic Material To The Vacuole In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. The Cytoplasm To Vacuole Targeting (Cvt) Pathway Transports The Vacuolar Hydrolase, Aminopeptidase I (Api), Whereas Pexophagy Mediates The Delivery Of Excess Peroxisomes For Degradation. Both The Cvt And Pexophagy Pathways Are Selective Processes That Specifically Recognize Their Cargo. In Contrast, Macroautophagy Nonselectively Transports Bulk Cytosol To The Vacuole For Recycling. Most Of The Import Machinery Characterized Thus Far Is Required For All Three Modes Of Transport. However, Unique Features Of Each Pathway Dictate The Requirement For Additional Components That Differentiate These Pathways From One Another, Including At The Step Of Specific Cargo Selection.We Have Identified Cvt9 And Its Pichia Pastoris Counterpart Gsa9. In S. Cerevisiae, Cvt9 Is Required For The Selective Delivery Of Precursor Api (Prapi) To The Vacuole By The Cvt Pathway And The Targeted Degradation Of Peroxisomes By Pexophagy. In P. Pastoris, Gsa9 Is Required For Glucose-Induced Pexophagy. Significantly, Neither Cvt9 Nor Gsa9 Is Required For Starvation-Induced Nonselective Transport Of Bulk Cytoplasmic Cargo By Macroautophagy. The Deletion Of Cvt9 Destabilizes The Binding Of Prapi To The Membrane And Analysis Of A Cvt9 Temperature-Sensitive Mutant Supports A Direct Role Of Cvt9 In Transport Vesicle Formation. Cvt9 Oligomers Peripherally Associate With A Novel, Perivacuolar Membrane Compartment And Interact With Apg1, A Ser/Thr Kinase Essential For Both The Cvt Pathway And Autophagy. In P. Pastoris Gsa9 Is Recruited To Concentrated Regions On The Vacuole Membrane That Contact Peroxisomes In The Process Of Being Engulfed By Pexophagy. These Biochemical And Morphological Results Demonstrate That Cvt9 And The P. Pastoris Homologue Gsa9 May Function At The Step Of Selective Cargo Sequestration.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	Predominant localization of non-specific lipid-transfer protein of the yeast Candida tropicalis in the matrix of peroxisomes. Pxp-18 Is A 14-Kda Major Peroxisomal Protein Of The Yeast Candida Tropicalis And A Homologue Of The Non-Specific Lipid-Transfer Protein (Nsltp) Of Mammals. Mammalian Nsltp Is Thought To Facilitate The Contact Of Membranes, To Stimulate Lipid-Transfer Between Them. If Pxp-18 Functions Like Nsltp, It Must Be Present On Organelle Membranes. Immunoelectron Microscopy Of C. Tropicalis Cells Indicated That Gold Particles, Which Visualized Pxp-18, Localized Exclusively In The Matrix Of Peroxisomes. Subcellular Fractionation Followed By Western Blotting Revealed The Association Of Pxp-18 With Peroxisomes In C. Tropicalis Cells. An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Revealed That Almost All The Pxp-18 Associated With Peroxisomes Was Detectable After The Solubilization Of The Organelle But Not Before, Implying The Predominance Of Pxp-18 Inside Peroxisomes. This Differential Assay Was Applied To The Intracellular Import Of The Intact And Truncated Pxp-18S Expressed In Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Cells. Most Of The Intact Pxp-18 Was Shown To Be Imported Into The Matrix Of Host-Cell Peroxisomes, Whereas The Truncated Pxp-18, Which Lacked The C-Terminal Tripeptide Pro-Lys-Leu, No Longer Targeted Peroxisomes. These Results Are Consistent With The View That Pxp-18 Is The Matrix Protein Of Peroxisomes And Must Function In A System Other Than That Of Lipid Transfer.
cerevisiae organelle contact peroxisome	[Yeast peroxisomes, their development and operation]. Yeast Peroxisomes (Microbodies) Were Studied, Particularly With Yeast Methylotrophs, Using Light-Optical Microscopy, Viz. Intravitam Phase- And Anoptral-Contrast Microscopy, With Cytochemical As Well As Fixed And Stained Objects. The Data Obtained Were Compared With Cytochemical As Well As Fixed And Stained Objects. The Data Obtained Were Compared With Other Evidence That We Had Gained On Methylotrophs Studied By Electron Microscopy And With The Results Obtained By Investigating The Peroxisomes Of Yeast Cultures Grown On Nutrient Containing Other Carbon Sources. The Activity Of Exocatalase And Endocatalase, The Enzymes Characteristic Of Peroxisomes, Was Assayed At Different Growth Phases Of Yeast Methylotrophs And Was Found To Be Correlated With The Cycle Of Development Of Peroxisomes. The Content Of Biotin And Inositol And Its Dynamics Were Studied In The Methylotroph Cells. Possible Origin Of Peroxisomes Is Discussed As Well As Their Development And The Mechanism Of Degradation. A Close Contact And Functional Relationship Have Been Established Between Peroxisomes And Mitochondria.
